## Starter

1. Name a machine that transforms gravitational potential energy to chemical energy
2. What is the chemical element, __K__, and what food is a good source of it? 
3. What vitamin is used in building eyes?

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Describe what digestion involves and why it is necessary

---

## The Digestive System

- You eat between $1kg$ and $2.5kg$ of food each day
- That is over $365kg$ a year, and over $30,000kg$ in a lifetime!
- The digestive system is made up of many parts, not just the stomach.

### You Are A Tube!

The digestive system is essentially a very long tube, going from your mouth to your rectum!

### What is digestion?

- The body carries out _digestion_ of food to convert large insoluble food molecules into smaller soluble ones.
- Small food molecules can pass through the walls of the samll intestine and then dissolve into the blood stream. Larage food molecules cannot do this.

__NB:__ _Insoluble_ means that it cannot dissolve in water (e.g. oil)

### Task: work with the person next to you to label the parts that you know.

### Why so many parts?

As food moves through your digestive system each part helps do different things:

- Get the food into you (without choking)
- Break down large food molecules
- Absorb nutrients/vitamins/minerals
- Absorb water
- Compress waste products
- Expell waste products

### Swallowing food without choking

How do we get food down our esophagus to our stomachs without choking?

#### Peristalsis

This is the process of contraction and relaxation of the muscles in the esophagus to propell the food down.

---

The muscles above the food contract to help push the food down, and the relax for the next lump of food or mouthful.

In conjunction with this, various organs in the mouth move to block airways so that you do not choke.

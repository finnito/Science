## Lesson Plans

1. Identify and describe different forms of energy
    - Go through slides on energy, make notes & answer questions
    - Complete the Energy Conversions worksheet
    - Complete the Education Perfect task: https://www.educationperfect.com/app/#/dashboard/homework/3013954

2. Describe the law of conservation of energy
    - Slides
    - Swinging bowling ball pendulum demo
    - What is energy song
    - Perpetual motion
    - Hydroelectric
    - Meta bow experiment

3. Describe the amount of energy in food using kilojoules (kJ) and discuss the energy needs of humans
    - Slides
    - Calorie counts in fods
    - How to lose fat

4. __Practical:__ Toy Circus

5. Explain why each type of nutrient is needed
    - Analyse the the nutritional information of various food packets
    - Explain the nutrients needed to do things like grow, get energy, healthy bones etc.
    - Portion sizes vs nutrients in 100g of the food

6. Distinguish between active and potential forms of energy
    - __Practical:__ Mega Bow Experiment

7. Describe and create a healthy diet
    - Homework prep: ask parents what their diet was when they were young
    - Create a poster documenting what makes up a good diet and gives people dos and don'ts
    - Homework: make a healthy meal for your family & document it with photos and some nutritional information

8. Describe the chemical tests to identify starch, glucose, protein and lipid in food
    - __Practical:__ Food tests
    - Demonstrate the tests in at the front of the class & make notes

9. Describe what digestion involves and why it is necessary
    - Introduce the idea of a tube that runs through the body
    - The important bits have to leave this tube and get into the body
    - Peristalsis demo
    - 1/3 of A4 pamphlet on a digestive disease, how to avoid, how to treat, population at risk etc.

10. Name the parts of the human digestion system and describe what happens to the food in each part
    - Mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum/anus

11. Describe how the products of digestion are absorbed and transported to the cells in the body

12. Describe how the energy in glucose in released through respiration

13. Revision / Catch-Up

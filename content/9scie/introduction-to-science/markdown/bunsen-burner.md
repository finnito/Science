## Safety

- The location of the lab fire extinguisher is known
- Safety glasses are worn
- Long hair is tied back and close clothing items tucked away
- The Bunsen burner was placed on a heat resistant surface
- The Bunsen burner is not too close to the edge of the desk

---

- The Bunsen is connected to the gas tap correctly
- The rubber tubing is checked for cracks or leaks
- The air hold on the Bunsen is closed
- The student can adjust the flame correctly

---

## Explain

1. Why is the flame yellow when the air hole is closed?
2. Why does the flame get hotter and change colour when the hole is gradually opened?

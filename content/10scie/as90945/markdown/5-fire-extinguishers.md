### Fire Extinguishers for the Home

The most likely types of fires to occur in the home are __cooking oil__ or __fat__ fires in the kitchen.

- The first extinguisher you should buy for your house is one for Class F fires
- This type of extinguisher is a wet chemical extinguisher
    - This type of extinguisher can also be used on most other fires in the home

---

- However, do not use a wet chemical extinguisher on a fire with a live electrical source
- Use an ABE Dry Powder extinguisher for most types of fires in your home __except__ a cooking oil or fat fire, as the pressure from the dry power extinguisher will cause the fire to spread.

### How Does it Work?

Contains a special blended Sodium Chloride based dry powder extinguishing agent. Heat from the fire causes it to cake and form a crust excluding air and dissipating heat from burning metal.

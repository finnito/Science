## Te Whāinga Ako

1. Define and list some structural, behavioural and physiological adaptation for different plants and animals.

<p class="instruction">Write the date and te whāinga ako in your book</p>

## Adaptations

- An attribute of an organism that helps them compete so they can survive and reproduce
- They come in three categories: __structural/physical__, __physiological__, __behavioural__

---

### Structural/Physical

> Physical features of an organism like the bill on a bird or the fur on a bear.

- Humans evolved standing upright on two feet (bipedalism) which allowed us to do long distance running to catch food & migrate

---

### Physiological

> Metabolic or physiologic adjustment within the cell, or tissues, of an organism. Internal chemical processes.

- The human metabolic system (conversion of sugar into energy/heat) increases when we are cold in order to keep us warmer

---

### Behavioural

> The things organisms do to survive. For example, bird calls and migration.

- Humans learned to use tools to create warm clothes/indoor environments so that we can survive cold areas

### "Fitness"

- Not cardiovascular fitness, but __evolutionary fitness__
- This means: how well you are adapted to your environment
- How well you can compete for resources, survive and reproduce!
- Better adaptations leads to greater ability to compete and reproduce!

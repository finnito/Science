- Go through each set of slides

## 2. Read through your notes

- After ensuring your notes are complete, read through them slowly.
- If you don't understand what something means, take a bright coloured pen and indicate this next to the note.

- At the end, seek clarification from your teacher about the points you highlighted, or post on [https://ask.lesueur.nz](https://ask.lesueur.nz)

## Ecology Hints

1. __Food chains & webs__: discuss the flow-on effects, and how it can affect multiple trophic levels
2. __Adaptations__: why do they exist? (two reasons)
3. __Trophic levels__: organisms compete for different resources depending where they are on the food chain (water/food/sunlight/space etc.)
4. __Graphs & tables__: read them very carefully and interpret them

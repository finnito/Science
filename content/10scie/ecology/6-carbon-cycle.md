## Akoranga 13 Mahi Tuatahi

1. Collect a whiteboard from the front
2. In pairs, name and describe the process through which decomposers gain nutrients from the surroundings
3. Extra: Quickly explain why it is important!

## Te Whﾄ（nga Ako

1. Describe the role and importance of decomposers in an ecosystem

<p class="instruction">Write the date and te whﾄ（nga ako in your book</p>

## Recall: Decomposers {.c2}

- They break down dead organic matter at each trophic level
- They do this through _extracellular digestion_ where they excrete enzymes, which can break down all kinds of things.

## {.c2}

![[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_pyramid)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Ecological_Pyramid.png/720px-Ecological_Pyramid.png)

- Some of the nutrients is used by the decomposers for growth,
- but most is left back into the soil to be used by __producers__ for growth and repair!

---

## Carbon-Based Life {.c2}

- Every living thing on Earth that we have discovered is made of essentially long chains of carbon atoms!
- We can follow the __carbon cycle__ to find out about life processes, just like we can follow the __energy cycle__!

## The Carbon Cycle

![[Source](https://microbiologyclass.com/carbon-cycle/)](https://microbiologyclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Carbon-Cycle-Diagram-1024x848.jpg)

<p class="instruction">Sketch this cycle into your book.</p>

### Photosynthesis

> The process of turning light energy and carbon dioxide into sugar.

- Recall from Year 9 the equation for photosynthesis (write it in your book if you remember)
- $light + water + \text{carbon dioxide} \rightarrow sugar + oxygen$

---

1. Where does photosynthesis occur?
2. What could happen to disrupt the amount of photosynthesis occurring?
3. Why is photosynthesis important?

<p class="instruction">Answer these questions in pairs on your whiteboards.</p>

---

### Respiration

> The process of turning sugar into energy for life.

- Write the equation in your book if you remember!
- $sugar + oxygen \rightarrow \text{carbon dioxide} + water + energy$

---

1. Where does respiration occur?
2. Why is $CO_{2}$ in the atmosphere relevant to us?
3. What could occur to change the amount of $CO_{2}$ in the atmosphere in good/bad ways?

<p class="instruction">Answer these questions in pairs on your whiteboards.</p>

## Ngohe: Annotate Your Diagram

For each arrow in your carbon cycle diagram, write 2-3 sentences explaining why/how/the importance of what is happening.

If you need to research on your device, that is allowed.

<p class="instruction">Work individually.</p>

## Akoranga 14 Mahi Tuatahi

1. Collect a whiteboard from the front
2. In pairs, explain the difference between these three words:
    - Habitat, niche, community
    - You may wish to use terms like _abiotic/biotic factors_, _environment_, _food chain_ etc.

## Te Whﾄ（nga Ako

1. Describe the role and importance of decomposers in an ecosystem

<p class="instruction">Write the date and te whﾄ（nga ako in your book</p>

## Recall: Decomposers {.c2}

- They break down dead organic matter at each trophic level
- They do this through _extracellular digestion_ where they excrete enzymes, which can break down all kinds of things.

## {.c2}

![[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_pyramid)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Ecological_Pyramid.png/720px-Ecological_Pyramid.png)

- Some of the nutrients is used by the decomposers for growth,
- but most is left back into the soil to be used by __producers__ for growth and repair!

---

## Carbon-Based Life {.c2}

- Every living thing on Earth that we have discovered is made of essentially long chains of carbon atoms!
- We can follow the __carbon cycle__ to find out about life processes, just like we can follow the __energy cycle__!

## The Carbon Cycle

![[Source](https://microbiologyclass.com/carbon-cycle/)](https://microbiologyclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Carbon-Cycle-Diagram-1024x848.jpg)

<p class="instruction">Sketch this cycle into your book.</p>

---

### Photosynthesis

> The process of turning light energy and carbon dioxide into sugar.

- Recall from Year 9 the equation for photosynthesis (write it in your book if you remember)
- $water + \text{carbon dioxide} \xrightarrow{\text{Light}} sugar + oxygen$

---

1. Where does photosynthesis occur?
2. What could happen to disrupt the amount of photosynthesis occurring?
3. Why is photosynthesis important?

<p class="instruction">Answer these questions in pairs on your whiteboards.</p>

---

### Respiration

> The process of turning sugar into energy for life.

- Write the equation in your book if you remember!
- $sugar + oxygen \rightarrow \text{carbon dioxide} + water + energy$

---

1. Where does respiration occur?
2. Why is $CO_{2}$ in the atmosphere relevant to us?
3. What could occur to change the amount of $CO_{2}$ in the atmosphere in good/bad ways?

<p class="instruction">Answer these questions in pairs on your whiteboards.</p>

## Ngohe: Annotate Your Diagram

For each arrow in your carbon cycle diagram, write 2-3 sentences explaining why/how/the importance of what is happening.

If you need to research on your device, that is allowed.

<p class="instruction">Work individually.</p>

---

## EP Task

1. Open the _Composting and the Carbon Cycle_ task on Education Perfect
2. Work individually to complete the task
3. Make notes in your exercise book about any new information you encounter
4. Once done, open the vocabulary Quizlet and get practicing!

## Te Whﾄ（nga Ako

1. Be able to use _habitat_, _niche_, and _community_ in an Ecology context.

<p class="instruction">Write the date and te whﾄ（nga ako in your book</p>

## Micro-Organisms {.c2}

- Micro-organisms/microbes are too small to see with the naked eye
- They are either unicellular (made of one cell), or a small group of cells
- Two main categories: bacteria and fungi

### Bacteria {.c2}

- Single celled organism (unicellular)
- Typically a few micrometers in size ($0.000001m$)
- Come in many different shapes (e.g. spirals, rods, spheres)

### Fungi (Decomposers) {.c2}

- Made of clusters of cells
- Fungi are sometimes too small to see, but once the group of cells gets too large it becomes visible to the naked eye
- Get their food by absorbing dissolved organic molecules

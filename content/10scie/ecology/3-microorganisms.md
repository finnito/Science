## Micro-Organisms {.c2}

![[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/E_coli_at_10000x%2C_original.jpg/500px-E_coli_at_10000x%2C_original.jpg)

- Micro-organisms/microbes are too small to see with the naked eye
- They are either unicellular (made of one cell), or a small group of cells
- Two main categories: bacteria and fungi

---

### Bacteria {.c2}

![[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/EscherichiaColi_NIAID.jpg/440px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID.jpg)

- Single celled organism (unicellular)
- Typically a few micrometers in size ($0.000001m$)
- Come in many different shapes (e.g. spirals, rods, spheres)

---

#### Structure of Bacteria {.c2}

![[Source]()](../assets/bacteria-lettered.png)

- Stick in your unlabelled bacteria diagram
- Label these structures!
    + Vacuole
    + Nucleus
    + Cell membrane
    + Cytoplasm
    + Mitochondria

---

### Fungi (Decomposers) {.c2}

![[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Fungi_collage.jpg)

- Made of clusters of cells
- Fungi are sometimes too small to see, but once the group of cells gets too large it becomes visible to the naked eye
- Get their food by absorbing dissolved organic molecules

---

## Function of Fungi

-  Fungi exist in ecosystems to break down dead organic matter into small molecules that are able to be be used by other living things
-  This is so that energy and nutrients can be reused!

---

#### Structure of Fungi {.c2}

![[Source](https://www.tes.com/lessons/AdOUyhtP3Iktwg/kingdom-fungi)](../assets/fungi-structure.png)

- Mycelium
- Spore
- Reproductive Structure
- Hyphae

## Tūhura: Fungi {.c2}

1. In desk pairs, collect a bag, slice of bread and permanent marker
2. Write your names on the bag
3. Write the date (12/02/2021)
4. Choose a place/thing to wipe the bread on - put this label on your bread
    - __Everyone should do somewhere different__
5. Expose the bread to your surface, seal the bag and pin it to the board!

## Akoranga 8 Mahi Tuatahi

1. Collect a whiteboard from the front of the room
2. In pairs, try your best to draw and label a diagram of a fungi __from memory__
3. __Extra__: Explain the function/role of fungi in ecosystems

---

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. Describe how bacterial feed by extra-cellular digestion
2. Describe the role and importance of decomposers in an ecosystem

<p class="instruction">Write the date and ngā whāinga ako in your book</p>

---

### Why are Decomposers Important? {.c2}

- They allow energy and nutrients to be recycled through an ecosystem
- Without them, the energy and nutrients would be lost, and we would have to have more _producers_ to get more energy into the system

### Extracellular Digestion {.c2}

![[Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Simple_diagram_of_bacterium_(en).svg)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Simple_diagram_of_bacterium_%28en%29.svg/1354px-Simple_diagram_of_bacterium_%28en%29.svg.png)

- __Cell membrane__: a semi-permeable membrane
- What does _semi-permeable_ mean?
- Only some things (semi) can go through it (permeable)! Typically very small molecules

---

### {.c2}

- Biology often uses carbohydrates (long chains of sugar molecules bound together)
- It is hard to absorb such large molecules through a membrane, so extracellular digestion is needed to break the carbohydrates into smaller sugars

- Humans, bacteria, fungi and other organisms all use __enzymes__ to break down molecules in extracellular digestion.
- Enzymes are molecules that can perform specific functions in biology e.g break some molecules down!

---

### Bread Tūhura/Investigation

- In humans we do extracellular digestion in our mouths, with the enzymes in our saliva!
- Take a piece of bread here, mush it up in your mouth but don't swallow it! Over time your should notice the flavour start to change. What do you observe?

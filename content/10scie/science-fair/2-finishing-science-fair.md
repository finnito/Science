## Repeatability, Reliability and Validity

It is important to consider these three aspects of your experiment. __It is okay to need improvements__, recognising where improvements are needed is __better__ than pretending you did it perfectly. Being critical allows you to improve!

- __Repeatable__: A method is repeatable if the same steps can be followed easily without anything going wrong.
- __Reliable__: An experiment is reliable if each repetition produces similar results
- __Valid__: An experiment is valid if you are actually measuring your intended variable - if no other variables are interfering with your measurement.

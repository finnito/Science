Re : <First Name> <Last Name> (<Class>, Science)

<First Name> has been working hard throughout the year on many different Science topics. We have discussed in class the upcoming Year 10 Science Exam, but here is the information written down for you.

What: Year 10 Science Exam (2hr)
When: November 18 and 19 during your Science periods
Content: All the content from all of our units this year

We are planning to use the four periods prior to the exam for revision. Many of you will wish to do revision outside of class, and to that end I have compiled a series of revision activities on Google Classroom for you. I will also outline them below.

1. All my notes are available on online: https://putaiao.nz/10scie/
2. There is a school revision site: https://sites.google.com/cashmere.school.nz/year-10-revision/
3. A list of things you need to know for the exam (available on Classroom)
4. A revision booklet will be handed out to you tomorrow in class (available on Classroom)
5. Revision powerpoints for each "strand" of Science (available on Classroom)
6. An Education Perfect revision task

In class we will make use of the Revision Booklet. This way you can try questions and ask for help where necessary. Using the other revision resources is something that you should do in your own time.

Kia angitu (be successful)!

## Recall: Respiration

- __Pātai__: What is respiration?
    + <mark>Respiration is the process that all organisms do to create energy for life (MRS C GREN)</mark>
- __Pātai__: What is needed to do respiration?
    + <mark>Oxygen and sugar are necessary for respiration</mark>
- __Pātai__: What are the byproducts of respiration?
    + <mark>Carbon dioxide, water and energy are produced by respiration</mark>

---

### Respiration as an Equation

\begin{aligned}
    sugar + oxygen &\rightarrow carbon\ dioxide + water + energy \newline
    C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2} &\rightarrow 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy
\end{aligned}

---

- __Pātai__: How do we get sugar for respiration?
    + <mark>We get sugar for respiration from food</mark>
- __Pātai__: How do we get oxygen for respiration?
    + <mark>We get oxygen for respiration from breathing</mark>
- __Pātai__: How does oxygen from the air get to our cells?
    + <marmk>Oxygen from the air we breathe is absorbed into our blood via structures in our lungs.

## Comparison/Whakatairite: Inhaled vs Exhaled Air

<mark>Make two small columns in your book titled Inhaled and Exhaled</mark>

- __Inhaled__
    + High oxygen concentration
    + Low water concentration
    + Low carbon dioxide concentration
- __Exhaled__
    + Low oxygen concentration
    + Higher water concentration
    + High carbon dioxide concentration

## The Anatomy of Breathing {.c2}

1. Air enters your __trachea__ (windpipe) through your mouth
2. Your trachea splits into two __bronchi__ - one bronchus for each lung
3. Inside the lung, each bronchus splits into many __bronchioles__
4. Each bronchiole attaches to a tiny inflatable air sac called an __alveoli__

### Adaptations of Alveoli{.c2}

5. Each alveoli is surrounded by capillaries which allow $O_{2}, CO_{2}$ and $H_{2}O$ to diffuse
    - Alveoli are tiny to increase surface area for maximum diffusion 
    - Alveoli have a moist walls to maintain their shape and allow diffusion of gases
    - Alveoli have a wall one cell thick to allow gas diffusion

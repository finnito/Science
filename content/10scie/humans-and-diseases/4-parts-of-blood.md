## O WhƒÅinga Ako

Describe the components of blood and their roles

---

1. Collect the blood cell sheet.
2. Glue in the empty table
3. Cut up the diagrams and statements
4. Be ready to order the diagrams and statements as we go through the notes.
5. Make any extra notes around the outside of the table as we go, today.

## Four Main Components

1. Plasma
2. Red Blood Cells
3. White Blood Cells
4. Platelets

### Plasma {.c2}

- The base liquid of your blood
- Carries water, salt, enzymes, hormones, nutrients and proteins to your cells
- Also carries waste products away
- Makes up $~55%$ of your blood volume

### Red Blood Cells {.c2}

- Carries oxygen to your cells using the haemoglobin protein
- Returns carbon dioxide from your cells to your lungs
- Make up about half of your blood

### White Blood Cells {.c2}

- Has a nucleus (like body cells)
- Form the army of your immune system - each one specially designed to kill different bacteria, fungi and viruses
- Can change shape to reach the site of infection (flexible)

### Platelets {.c2}

- Form blood clots at a site of bleeding
- Are made of fragments of other cells

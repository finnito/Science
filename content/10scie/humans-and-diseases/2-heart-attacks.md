## Arteries and Plaques {.c2}

- Arteries carry blood __away__ from the heart
- Throughout our life we build up plaques in our arteries
- A <mark>plaque is a fatty/waxy substance that restricts blood flow</mark>

### Risk Factors {.c2}

There are certain things that will increase your risk of developing more plaque over your lifetime. Some things we can control, others we cannot.

- age
- height and weight
- __blood pressure__
	+ Affected by a high fat/salt diet
- __cholesterol__
	+ This is a type of fat we get from animal-based products
- personal medical history
- family medical history
- __smoking status__

## Heart Attacks {.c2}

- Over time these plaques grow larger, and sometimes <mark>a piece of plaque can break off</mark>!
- This is a problem because <mark>__a blood clot forms__</mark>
	+ A blood clot is where liquid blood goes semi-solid. It does this to reducing/stop bleeding.
- This <mark>clot will stop blood flow in the artery</mark>
- This is dangerous because <mark>blood carries oxygen which our cells need for respiration</mark>!

### {.c2}

- If this occurs in a coronal artery (<mark>an artery that supplies the heart</mark>), then a section of the heart <mark>will not receive blood</mark>
- If no blood is flowing, then <mark>the muscle supplied by that artery will not receive oxygen</mark> and will die
- This is called <mark>__myocardial infarction (MI)__</mark> or a _heart attack_
 	+ __myo__ - muscle
	+ __cardial__ - heart
	+ __infarction__ - death

### Treatment {.c2}

- __Blood thinning medication__, so that clots are less common
- __Blood pressure medication__, so that your arteries relax and widen
- __Cholesterol reducing medication (statins)__, to reduce formation of future plaques
- __Surgery to put in a stent__, to hold your artery open

### Prevention

- __Quit smoking__
- __Eat less cholesterol__ overall
	+ __LDL cholesterol is bad__ because it gets built up into plaques!
	+ __HDL cholesterol is okay__ because your cells can use it more easily
- __Eat less salt__ to reduce blood pressure
- __Eat less fat__ because plaques are partly made of fat
- __Limit alcohol__

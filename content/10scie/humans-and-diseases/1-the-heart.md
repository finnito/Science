## Circulation

- <mark>The human body is made up of two circulatory loops</mark>
- One brings __oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart__ and __takes deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs__
- The other __takes oxygenated blood to the body__ and __returns deoxygenated blood to the heart from the body__

<p class="instruction">Collect a heart diagram and glue it on its own page in the middle!</p>

## Left Atrium {.c2}

Receives oxygenated blood from the lungs (pulmonary circulation)

## Left Ventricle {.c2}

Pumps oxygenated blood out to body via the aortic valve (systemic circulation). Has a thick muscle wall to help pump the blood a long distance at a high pressure!

## What about all the tubes?

- The Superior (top) and Inferior (bottom) Vena Cava carry deoxygenated blood to the heart from the body (systemic circulation).
- The Pulmonary Artery carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs - that's why it splits in two!
- The Pulmonary Veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs - there is two per side!
- The Aorta carries lots of high pressure oxygenated blood to the body - that's why it's huge!

---

## What about the valves?

- Valves exist to stop blood flowing back the wrong way!
- This is important because you don't want deoxygenated blood flowing backwards, when you body needs oxygenated blood going forwards!

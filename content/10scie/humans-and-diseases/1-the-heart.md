## Circulation

- <mark>The human body is made up of two circulatory loops</mark>
- Pulmonary (of the Lungs) Circulation
	+ Brings __oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart__ and __takes deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs__
- Systemic (of the body) Circulation
	+ __Takes oxygenated blood to the body__ and __returns deoxygenated blood to the heart from the body__
- These loops are __parallel__ - they work independently of each other.

## Ngohe/Task: Parts of the Heart {.c2}

1. Collect a diagram of the heart & glue it in
2. Use the slides on Classroom to make notes about the different parts of the heart

## Left Atrium {.c2}

Receives oxygenated blood from the lungs (pulmonary circulation)

![[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart))](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Diagram_of_the_human_heart_%28cropped%29.svg/1920px-Diagram_of_the_human_heart_%28cropped%29.svg.png)

---

## Left Ventricle {.c2}

Pumps oxygenated blood out to body via the aortic valve (systemic circulation). Has a thick muscle wall to help pump the blood a long distance at a high pressure!

## Right Atrium {.c2}

Receives deoxygenated blood from the body (systemic circulation).

## Right Ventricle {.c2}

Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the pulmonary valve (pulmonary circulation).

## What about all the tubes?

- The Superior (top) and Inferior (bottom) Vena Cava carry deoxygenated blood to the heart from the body (systemic circulation).
- The Pulmonary Artery carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs - that's why it splits in two!
- The Pulmonary Veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs - there is two per side!
- The Aorta carries lots of high pressure oxygenated blood to the body - that's why it's huge!

---

## What about the valves?

- Valves exist to stop blood flowing back the wrong way!
- This is important because you don't want deoxygenated blood flowing backwards, when you body needs oxygenated blood going forwards!

---

## Arteries vs Veins

- Arteries carry blood __away__ from the heart (a for arteries, a for away)
- Veins carry blood __towards__ the heart

## Ngohe/Task: Flow Direction {.c2}

<mark>Starting with deoxygenated blood returning to the heart through the superior and inferior vena cava</mark>, make a numbered list describing where it goes after that. You will need to use your notes to figure it out!

## {.c2}

1. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium of the heart via the superior and inferior vena cava.
2. The right side of the heat compresses, pushing the blood into the right ventricle.
3. Deoxygenated blood leaves the heart and travels to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries.
4. The lungs oxygenate the blood.
5. Oxygenated blood from the lungs travels to the left atrium of the heart via the pulmonary veins (two per lung).
6. The left hand side of the heart compresses, pushing the blood into the left ventricle.
7. Oxygenated blood leaves the left ventricle via the aorta (and artery) to the body.

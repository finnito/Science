## Blood Vessels

- Any tube that carries blood within the body is called a blood vessel
- There are three that we are interested in:
	+ Arteries
	+ Veins
	+ Capillaries

---

### Arteries {.c2}

- Carry blood away from the heart
- <mark>Have a thick outer layer of elastin</mark>
	+ This is important because the artery expands as the pulse travels through it
- <mark>Have a thick layer of muscle</mark>
	+ Strong to resist the high blood pressure
- <mark>Relatively narrow lumen for the blood to travel through</mark>
	+ This keeps the blood at a high pressure and moving quickly

### Veins {.c2}

- Carry blood towards the heart
- <mark>Have a thin layer of muscle</mark>
	+ This is because veins are not at such a high pressure
- <mark>Have a large lumen</mark> so that more blood can flow with less friction
- <mark>Have one-way valves</mark> to stop backflow of deoxygenated blood.

### Capillaries {.c2}

- <mark>Carry blood to individual cells</mark>
- <mark>This is where oxygen is transferred from the blood to the cells</mark>
- <mark>Extremely narrow</mark>
	+ This is important because it helps get blood to every cell
- <mark>Vessel wall about one cell thick</mark>
	+ The narrow vessel wall also helps oxygen and nutrients move from the capillary into the cell

### Ngohe/Task: Compare and Contrast

1. Head up a section in your book __Arteries vs Veins__
2. Make three columns across your page
	+ Arteries
	+ Both
	+ Veins
3. Summarise your notes into the three columns. The differences, and things that they have in similar!
4. Sketch a diagram of each at the bottom of the column

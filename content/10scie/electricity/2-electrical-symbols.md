## Akoranga 3 Mahi Tuatahi

Stella shuffles around her house wearing a pair of wool socks. She wants to shock one of her friends.

1. Explain why she has to shuffle around the floor
2. Explain why a shock will be produced

---

### Whakatika / Answer

1. Explain why she has to shuffle around the floor<br>_This applies __friction__ between the socks and the floor. This will __remove electrons__ (negative charge) from the socks, leaving them positively charged._<br>
2. Explain why a shock will be produced<br>When there is an __imbalance in charge__ (static electricity), the charges will want to __balance out__ and become __neutral__. This often occurs as an __electric shock__.

## Electrical Diagrams {.c2}

- A big part of Electricity is being able to draw and label diagrams. This helps us understand questions and is a key skill for the test.
-  We need to learn a series of common symbols that get used in diagrams.

### Symbols, Names and Uses

<p class="instruction">In your book, draw the symbol, write the name and the use (if applicable).</p>

__Wires__: A straight line with right-angled corners that connects electrical components

---

#### Open Switch

> A break in the circuit - stops the current from flowing.

---

#### Closed Switch

> Makes the circuit complete - allows the current to flow.

![[Source](https://www.switchelectronics.co.uk/blog/post/electricalsymbols.html)](../assets/closed-switch.png)

---

#### Ammeter

> Measures the flow of current in the circuit. Placed in the circuit __in series__.

![[Source](https://www.switchelectronics.co.uk/blog/post/electricalsymbols.html)](../assets/ammeter.png)

---

#### Voltmeter

> Measures the amount of voltage used up by components in the circuit. Placed in the circuit __in parallel__.

---

#### Battery

> Provides energy to the circuit.

---

#### Cell

> Provides energy to the circuit.

![[Source](https://www.switchelectronics.co.uk/blog/post/electricalsymbols.html)](../assets/cell.png)

---

#### Diode

> Only lets the current flow in one direction (the direction of the arrow).

![[Source](https://www.switchelectronics.co.uk/blog/post/electricalsymbols.html)](../assets/diode.png)

---

#### Fuse

> Heats up and breaks when the current gets too high. Protects the circuit from electrical fires.

---

#### Lamp

> Creates light by using up energy.

---

#### Motor

> Uses energy to create rotational motion.

![[Source](https://www.switchelectronics.co.uk/blog/post/electricalsymbols.html)](../assets/motor.png)

---

#### Resistor

> Reduces the current in the circuit by impeding flow of electrons.

![[Source](https://www.switchelectronics.co.uk/blog/post/electricalsymbols.html)](../assets/resistor.png)

---

#### Variable Resistor

> A resistor that can be changed to reduce the current more or less.

![[Source](https://www.switchelectronics.co.uk/blog/post/electricalsymbols.html)](../assets/variable-resistor.png)

---

### Connecting Components in Series

> Connecting in series means to put them in the same loop.

![[Source](https://www.quora.com/How-can-an-ammeter-cause-a-short-circuit)](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-33599abf2a6c694f7d3cc3b1cd531e7e)

- The resistor and ammeter are __in series__ because they are in the same loop.
- __Always__ place an ammeter in series. Placing it in parallel will break it.

---

### Connecting Components in Parallel

> Parallel components exist on separate loops of the circuit.

![[Source](https://scienceaid.net/physics/electricity/circuits.html)](https://scienceaid.net/images/f/f4/seriescircuit.jpg)

- The light bulbs and ammeter are in series, but the voltmeter is in parallel.
- Always place a voltmeter in parallel because it measures the "different" in voltage between two points.

#### Pātai {.c2}

1. Neatly draw these circuits in your book.
2. In pairs, decide whether each circuit is a __parallel__ or __series__ circuit.

### Whakawai / Practise: Drawing Circuits

1. A circuit with a battery, two bulbs in series.
2. A circuit with a battery, two bulbs, an open switch and a resistor in series.
3. A circuit with a battery, two bulbs in parallel, with a switch that can turn both lights on/off.
4. A circuit with a battery, two bulbs in parallel, with a switch that can turn one bulb on/off.
5. A circuit with a battery, three bulbs and a switch, where two bulbs can be controlled by the switch, and the third is always on.

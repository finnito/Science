## Charge, Current and Voltage {.c2}

- We are moving on from thinking about static electricity, to thinking about electricity that flows: __current electricity__.
- Split part of your page into three columns:
    + __Current__, __Charge__ and __Voltage__

### Current ($I$) {.c2}

- In _current electricity_, charges have to flow through a conductor (e.g. copper wire).
- The charges that flow are __electrons__.
- These electrons carry a negative charge, and move from the negative to the positive terminal of the power supply.

### {.c2}

![[Source](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/483777/confused-with-diodes-and-conventional-vs-real-current-flow)](../assets/electron-flow.jpg)

- Current is given the letter $I$ in equations, as it was historically known as intensité du courant (French).
- It is measured in a unit called Amperes (Amps) or A for short.
- It is measured by a __ammeter__ which is placed __in series__ in a circuit.

#### Pātai Tahi (Q1)

Discuss with the person next to you, why is it that negative charges flow, and positive charges do not? Write your conclusion down in your book.

- Electrons carry negative charge, and protons carry positive charge.
- In conductors, electrons are loosely held and can move freely throughout a solid in a _"sea"_ of electrons.
- Protons cannot move, because they reside in the nucleus of the atom, and atoms are fixed in place.

---

### Charge ($Q$) {.c2}

- Each electron carries some amount of charge
- This charge is given the letter $Q$
- Charge is measured in a unit called a $Coulomb$ (C).

### Voltage ($V$) {.c2}

- At the negative terminal of a power supply, there are a large number of electrons present.
- Because they all have the same charge, they repel each other.
- This _"pressure"_ to get away from each other is called __Voltage__
- As electrons pass through different components (bulb, resistor etc.) the voltage decreases.
- Components with a higher voltage do more __work__ (e.g. get brighter/warmer)
- The total voltage must be _"consumed"_.

### Tūhura/Investigation: Ohm's Law

1. Open the [PhET Simulation](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/ohms-law/latest/ohms-law_en.html) on Google Classroom.
2. The __voltage__ and __resistance__ sliders allow you to change those properties of the circuit.
3. __What impact does increasing the voltage have on the circuit?__ Extra: Why?
4. __What impact does increasing the resistance have on the circuit?__ Extra: Why?

#### Whakatika

1. __What impact does increasing the voltage have on the circuit?__ Extra: Why?<br>Increasing the voltage increases the current in the circuit. Because a higher "_pressure_" is exerted by the power source, causing more electrons to flow around the circuit.
2. __What impact does increasing the resistance have on the circuit?__ Extra: Why?<br>Increasing the resistance decreases the current in the circuit. Because there is more friction acting upon the electrons, stopping them from flowing as freely.

1. Open the [PhET Simulation](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/john-travoltage/latest/john-travoltage_en.html) on Google Classroom
2. Describe & explain what happens when you move his foot across the mat multiple times.
3. Describe & explain what happens when you bring his hand close to the door handle.
4. Investigate to see if there is a relationship between the amount of charge needed to cause a spark, and the distance of the hand to the door handle.

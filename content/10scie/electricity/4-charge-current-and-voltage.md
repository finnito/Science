## Charge, Current and Voltage {.c2}

- We are moving on from thinking about static electricity, to thinking about electricity that flows: __current electricity__.
- Split part of your page into three columns:
    + __Current__, __Charge__ and __Voltage__

### Current ($I$) {.c2}

- In _current electricity_, charges have to flow through a conductor (e.g. copper wire).
- The charges that flow are __electrons__.
- These electrons carry a negative charge, and move from the negative to the positive terminal of the power supply.
- __NB__: _Conventional current_ is an old concept from when we thought that positive charges flow.

![[Source](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/483777/confused-with-diodes-and-conventional-vs-real-current-flow)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cuhsg.png)

- Current is given the letter $I$ in equations, as it was historically known as intensité du courant (French).
- It is measured in a unit called Amperes (Amps) or A for short.
- It is measured by a __ammeter__ which is placed __in series__ in a circuit.

#### Pātai Tahi (Q1)

Discuss with the person next to you, why is it that negative charges flow, and positive charges do not? Write your conclusion down in your book.

- Electrons carry negative charge, and protons carry positive charge.
- In conductors, electrons are loosely held and can move freely throughout a solid in a _"sea"_ of electrons.
- Protons cannot move, because they reside in the nucleus of the atom, and atoms are fixed in place.

---

### Charge ($Q$) {.c2}

- Each electron carries some amount of charge
- This charge is given the letter $Q$
- Charge is measured in a unit called a $Coulomb$ (C).
- In one second, a current of $1A$ will carry $1C$ of charge past a point.

### Voltage ($V$) {.c2}

- At the negative terminal of a power supply, there are a large number of electrons present.
- Because they all have the same charge, they repel each other.
- This _"pressure"_ to get away from each other is called __Voltage__
- As electrons pass through different components (bulb, resistor etc.) the voltage decreases.
- Components with a higher voltage do more __work__ (e.g. get brighter/warmer)
- The total voltage must be _"consumed"_.

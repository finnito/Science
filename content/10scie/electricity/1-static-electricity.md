2. Glue in the learning outcomes/_ngā whāinga ako_ sheet
2. Write the date in your book
3. Write the learning outcome for today:
    - Explain how static electricity is created by the removal or addition of electric charge.

- The dome builds up a charge, and this can be used to do all kinds of interesting things
- The wand is used to complete the circuit and to stop charge building up
- __Key__: Opposites attract and likes repel

----

### Tinfoil Pie Containers {.c2}

- __Pātai__: Why do they not fly off straight away?
- __Whakatika__: Because the circuit is complete; no charge building up.
- __Pātai__: What will happen when the circuit is broken?
- __Whakatika__: Positive charge begins to build up on the dome, so the tinfoil pie contains repel each other.

### Lightning {.c2}

- __Pātai__: What is happening when the circuit is __not__ complete?
- __Whakatika__: Charge is building up in the dome
- __Pātai__: Why does lightning occur?
- __Whakatika__: Because the charges want to balance out.

## Akoranga 2 Mahi Tuatahi

1. Collect a whiteboard from the front
2. In pairs, draw and label a diagram of an atom!

## Te Whāinga Ako

1. Explain how static electricity is created by the removal or addition of electric charge.

<p class="instruction">Write the date and te whāinga ako in your book</p>

## Atomic Structure {.c2}

- __Nucleus__: The centre of the atom (strongly held: protons, neutrons)
- __Orbit__: Loosely held _electrons_ orbit around the nucleus

---

### Removing/Adding Charge {.c2}

- The __nucleus__ is strongly held and is positively charged because it contains __protons__ which have a positive charge.
- Neutrons have no charge (neutral)
- The __electrons__ are loosely held, and are negatively charged.
- Electrons can be removed from a material via __friction__

### Pātai: Why can't protons (positive charge) be removed?

Discuss with the person next to you!

---

#### Whakatika

- Protons are in the nucleus which is strongly held
- The nucleus is the core of what makes up matter
- Therefore, we can more easily remove the loosely held electrons
- To remove the protons is to change what the matter is

## Static Electricity

> An imbalance of charge on the surface of, or inside a material. Imbalances in charge will always attempt to __balance out__ (become neutral), by having charges move.

## Electrostatic Induction {.c2}

- __Bringing a charged object near a neutral one can induce a localised opposite charge. Therefore, creating attraction between the two objects__
- Make a note of this diagram and notes in your book.
- Explain how you can use an electroscope to determine whether an object is charged or not.

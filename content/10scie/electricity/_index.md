## Learning Outcomes _/ NgƒÅ WhƒÅinga Ako_ 

1. __Electricity__
    1. Explain how static electricity is created by the removal or addition of electric charge (and is measured in Coulombs)
    2. Describe electric current in terms of a moving flow of charge (Coulombs per second)
    3. Describe voltage in terms of the amount of electrical energy carried by each Coulomb of charge
    4. Describe how resistance controls the flow of electric current
    5. Describe power as the rate at which electrical energy is used
2. __Circuits__
    1. Draw circuit diagrams (with power supply, wires, switch, voltmeter, ammeter, bulb, resistor, fuse) 
    2. Construct series and parallel circuits
    3. Measure and explain the behavior of voltage, current and resistance in series and parallel circuits
    4. Use Ohm‚Äôs Law ($V=IR$) and the power equation ($P=IV$) 
3. __Using Electricity__
    1. Identify factors that affect electrical safety in the workplace
    2. Identify and explain the risks of short-circuits
    3. Explain how a fuse works

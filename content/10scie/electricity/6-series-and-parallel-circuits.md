## Series Circuits {.c2}

The current has only one path to flow around

---

### {.c2}

The current is the same all around the circuit

### {.c2}

![](../assets/series-circuit-shared-voltage.png)

- The voltage is shared (equally) between the components in the loop if they have the same resistance
- All the components voltage adds to the voltage of the power supply
- All of the voltage must be consumed

<p class="instruction">Copy this diagram into your book.</p>

### Ngohe/Task

1. Collect a sheet from the front
2. Cut it to size and glue it into your book
3. Work in pairs to complete the __Series__ side of the sheet

---

### Tūhura/Investigation {.c2}

1. Collect a electricity tray.
2. Build the circuit on the right.
3. Set the voltage to $12V$.
4. Add a second bulb to the circuit.
5. Write down your observation and explanation in your book!
6. Pack up your electricity tray and return it to the trolley.

## Parallel Circuit {.c2}

The current has multiple paths to flow around

![](../assets/parallel-circuit-multiple-paths.png)

---

### {.c2}

The current is shared between paths

![](../assets/parallel-circuit-shared-current.png)

---

### {.c2}

![](../assets/parallel-circuit-shared-voltage.png)

- The voltage is shared between components on each separate path
- Each path voltage adds to the voltage of the power supply

<p class="instruction">Copy this diagram into your book.</p>

---

### Ngohe/Task

Work in pairs to complete the __Parallel__ side of the sheet you collected earlier.

---

### Tūhura/Investigation {.c2}

1. Collect a electricity tray.
2. Copy this diagram into your book.
2. Build the circuit on the right and set $V=12V$ (measure with your multimeter too).
4. Use a __multimeter__ to measure the unknown voltages.
5. Move the ammeter to measure the current at the unknown points.
6. Pack up your electricity tray and return it to the trolley.

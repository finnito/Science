## 1. Ensure your notes are complete

- Go through each set of slides
- Read them thoroughly and add any missing notes to your exercise book
- __Do not re-write your notes__ - this practice is time consuming and not very beneficial.

---

## 2. Read through your notes

- After ensuring your notes are complete, read through them slowly.
- If you don't understand what something means, take a bright coloured pen and indicate this next to the note.
- This should be a slow process and not something you do in 5 minutes.
- At the end, seek clarification from your teacher or the internet about the points you highlighted.

## 3. Create a single sided A4 summary notes sheet {.c2}

- Can be a mind-map, or more _organised_ boxes
- Include diagrams
- Fit it all onto one page

## 4. Check your understanding of the learning outcomes

- In your exercise book, write each learning outcome and then use your notes to write a paragraph showing your understanding and explaining about that learning outcome.
- The learning outcomes can be found on the [Geology home page](/10scie/geology/)!

e.g. __Explain the theory of plate tectonics using many sources of evidence__

Alfred Wegner was the first to propose the idea that the Earth's crust may be broken up into parts that can move. He was unable to provide a mechanism for how the plates _could_ move, he just hypothesised that they _did_.

Some of the evidence he cited was:

- the shape of the continents - they seemed to fit together
- similar geology found on separate continents indicating they were once joined
- similar flora and fauna on separate continents indicating they were once joined
- organisms found on disparate continents - across gaps of ocean so large they could not travel across without them being closer together in the past.

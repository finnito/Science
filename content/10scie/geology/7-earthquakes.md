## Akoranga 20 WhƒÅinga Ako

1. Use plate tectonics to explain why and where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen
2. Use scientific language: epicenter, focus, p and s waves

## Tectonic Plates & Fault Lines {.c2}

- Tectonic plates are the major pieces of the crust that slowly move across Earth's mantle
- These plates cannot slide smoothly past each other; instead <mark>they get stuck and build up pressure and energy</mark>
- This <mark>pressure and energy causes the crust to fracture at __fault lines__</mark>
- <mark>When the pressure and energy gets too high, the rock can slip and cause an Earthquake!</mark>

### Recall: Divergent Plate Boundaries {.c2}

- New crust is created by cooling magma in the gap
- <mark>No earthquakes occur here</mark>
- Forms a mid-ocean ridge, or a rift valley on land
- Volcanoes occur in the gap

---

### Recall: Convergent Plate Boundaries {.c2}

- Oceanic crust is destroyed (melted in mantle)
- <mark>Earthquakes occur here deep in the oceanic trench</mark>
- <mark>Can form mountains and ocean trenches</mark>
- Volcanoes may occur near here

### Recall: Transform (Conservative) Plate Boundaries {.c2}

- No crust is created or destroyed
- <mark>Earthquakes occur near the surface here</mark>
- No mountains or trenches formed
- No volcanic activity

## Earthquakes

- Occur on the surface of transform boundaries
- Occur deep underground at convergent boundaries
- Minor ones may occur due to volcanic activity
- __Focus__: The point underground where the tectonic plates _slip_
- __Epicenter__: The point on the surface directly above the focus
- __Seismic Waves__: Vibrations in the crust caused by the violet release of energy over _a short period of time_ during an earthquake

---

### Seismic Waves

- Seismic waves come in two different types of vibration - they have slightly different properties which we need to know.
- <mark>Make two columns in your book with the headings __P Waves__ and __S Waves__</mark>
- In the real world, earthquakes tend to be a mix of p and s waves which creates a more complex motion.

---

#### P Waves {.c2}

- P for _primary_, because they travel the fastest and arrive first during and earthquake.
- Compress and extension __in the direction of the wave__.
- The particles oscillate backwards and forwards, but don't move _along_.

---

#### S Waves {.c2}

- S for _secondary_ because they travel a little slower than _s waves_.
- Particles oscillate up and down __90deg to the direction of the wave__.
- The particles oscillate backwards and forwards, but don't move _along_.

We can do a similar process with p and s waves to measure how deep and far away the earthquake was!

### Ngohe: Locating the Earthquake Epicenter

- Seismographs are placed in many locations around New Zealand and the rest of the world.
- They vibrate when earthquakes shake their housing.
- We can use three or more seismographs to __triangulate__ the epicenter of the earthquake.
- <mark>Collect a worksheet from the front!</mark> Draw a circle of the correct radius around each location and find the earthquake epicenter!

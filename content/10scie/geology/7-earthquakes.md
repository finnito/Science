## Akoranga 20 Whāinga Ako

1. Use plate tectonics to explain why and where earthquakes occur

---

## Tectonic Plates & Fault Lines {.c2}

- Tectonic plates are the major pieces of the crust that slowly move across Earth's mantle
- These plates cannot slide smoothly past each other; instead <mark>they get stuck and build up pressure and energy</mark>
- This <mark>pressure and energy causes the crust to fracture at __fault lines__</mark>
- <mark>When the pressure and energy gets too high, the rock can slip and cause an Earthquake!</mark>

## Akoranga 21 Mahi Tuatahi

<p class="instruction">Complete this paragraph in your book.</p>

The energy ________ travels outwards as _____.  The point in the Earth’s crust where this happens is called the _____, the point directly above the focus on the Earth’s surface is called the _________.  Seismologists use ___________ to determine the magnitude and ________ of earthquakes.

__Words:__ seismographs, focus, location, waves, epicentre, released

---

## Akoranga 21 Whāinga Ako

1. Use scientific language: epicenter, focus, p and s waves
2. Be able to locate and measure earthquakes

---

### Recall: Divergent Plate Boundaries {.c2}

- New crust is created by cooling magma in the gap
- <mark>No earthquakes occur here</mark>
- Forms a mid-ocean ridge, or a rift valley on land
- Volcanoes occur in the gap

![[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_boundary)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Continental-continental_constructive_plate_boundary.svg/1200px-Continental-continental_constructive_plate_boundary.svg.png)

---

### Recall: Convergent Plate Boundaries {.c2}

- Oceanic crust is destroyed (melted in mantle)
- <mark>Earthquakes occur here deep in the oceanic trench</mark>
- <mark>Can form mountains and ocean trenches</mark>
- Volcanoes may occur near here

---

### Recall: Transform (Conservative) Plate Boundaries {.c2}

- No crust is created or destroyed
- <mark>Earthquakes occur near the surface here</mark>
- No mountains or trenches formed
- No volcanic activity

## Earthquakes

- Occur on the surface of transform boundaries
- Occur deep underground at convergent boundaries
- Minor ones may occur due to volcanic activity
- __Focus__: The point underground where the tectonic plates _slip_
- __Epicenter__: The point on the surface directly above the focus
- __Seismic Waves__: Vibrations in the crust caused by the violet release of energy over _a short period of time_ during an earthquake

---

### Ngohe: Locating the Earthquake Epicenter

- Seismographs are placed in many locations around New Zealand and the rest of the world.
- They vibrate when earthquakes shake their housing.
- We can use three or more seismographs to __triangulate__ the epicenter of the earthquake.
- <mark>Collect a worksheet from the front!</mark> Draw a circle of the correct radius around each location and find the earthquake epicenter!

---

### Seismic Waves

- Seismic waves come in two different types of vibration - they have slightly different properties which we need to know.
- <mark>Make two columns in your book with the headings __P Waves__ and __S Waves__</mark>
- In the real world, earthquakes tend to be a mix of p and s waves which creates a more complex motion.

---

#### P Waves {.c2}

- P for _primary_, because they <mark>travel the fastest and arrive first</mark> during an earthquake.
- <mark>Compression and extension</mark> __in the direction of the wave__.

---

#### S Waves {.c2}

- S for _secondary_ because they travel <mark>slower than _p waves_</mark>.
- Particles <mark>oscillate up and down</mark> __90deg to the direction of the wave__.

### Ngohe: Complete This Paragraph

When the _________ is too much in the crust, an _________ will occur. The point in the crust where it occurs is called the _________.
The first ________ waves to reach the surface are the ________; the point they first appear at is called the ________. The next type of waves to arrive are the _________. They arrive second because they are _________ than the first waves. P-waves have a ________ and ________ pattern while S-waves have a ________ and _________ motion. In reality, earthquakes are a combination of both of these wave types.

__Words__: compression, secondary (s) waves, expansion, slower, earthquake, up, seismic, stress, primary (p) waves, down, epicenter, focus

### Richter Scale

- Developed for <mark>use around the San Adreas Fault</mark>
- <mark>Measures energy</mark>
- Is only very accurate for that locality
- Each number represents 31.6 times the energy of the previous number!

---

### Mercalli Intensity Scale {.c2}

- <mark>Measures the impact on humans and the land</mark>
- It is more useful in a variety of locations
- In reality, places like GeoNet use an average of different scales to generate a more accurate and representative magnitude number.
- E.g. the [Christchurch Feb 11 quake](https://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/technical/3468575)

### Ngohe: Assigning Magnitues to Historical NZ Earthquakes

1. Collect a sheet from the front
2. Glue it into your book
3. Read the left hand side about the different levels of the _Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale_
4. Work with the person next to your to decide what magnitude you would assign it using the MMI scale

---

### Seismographs

- A seismograph is a device that vibrates as an earthquake passes through it
- This vibration is recorded as a series of peaks/troughs on a graph
- This graph can be used to calculate the maximum acceleration of the ground and therefore help determine the magnitude of the quake
- There are [many (52) seismographs around New Zealand](https://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/drums)
- They are used to get many measurements for a more accurate magnitude value and to help locate the earthquake!

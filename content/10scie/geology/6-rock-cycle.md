## The Rock Cycle

> All rocks are recycled over and over again thanks to the mantle, and processed on the crust that break down rocks.

<p class="instruction">Collect a rock cycle diagram from the front of class and glue it into your book.</p>

There are three types of rock that we are interested in:

1. Sedimentary
2. Igneous
3. Metamorphic

---

### Sedimentary Rocks {.c2}

- Formed through the compaction of broken down rocks.
- Rocks can be broken down by the wind, rain and other processes, and these small particles of rock are carried by rivers to lakes and the ocean.
- Once they settle to the bottom, layers start to form and the pressure increases from all the weight above!
- This pressure starts to compact the sediments into _sedimentary rock_. It is quite brittle!

### {.c2}

- Castle Hill and Cave Stream are made of limestone - a sedimentary rock
- Sandstone and mudstone are also sedimentary rocks
- Pancake rocks are made of sedimentary rocks, too!
- <mark>Sedimentary rocks are easily eroded,</mark> this is why the blowholes and Cave Stream could form.

### Igneous Rock

- Igneous rock is formed when lava/magma cools down and solidifies
- If it cools above the surface, it cools quite rapidly. This is called __extrusive igneous rock__.
- If it cools below the surface of the crust, it cools comparatively slowly. This is called __intrusive igneous rock__ (think intrusive --> in).
- Intrusive igneous forms rocks with large crystals, and extrusive forms smaller crystals.

#### Task/Ngohe: Categorise These Rocks

##### Whakatika

- Extrusive (small crystals): A, B and C
- Intrusive (larger crystals): D, E and F

---

#### {.c2}

- When you go walking/biking/running on Banks Peninsula, the large rocks that you go over are _igneous rocks_!
- Lots of them make really good climbing crags, or mountain bike tracks (e.g. Lava Flow near Bowenvale).

### Metamorphic Rock {.c2}

- Metamorphic rocks are rocks that have _changed shape_ e.g. been recycled
- They get recycled by the mantle, where they are subject to intense __heat and pressure__
- They typically have a banded appearance

### Task/Ngohe: Identify Rocks

1. Collect a tray and magnifying glass from the front
2. Use the magnifying glass to inspect each rock. Look for bands, crystals and other features!
3. Categorise each rock on the tray as Igneous, Sedimentary or Metamorphic.
4. ⬆️ Write their names next to your notes in your exercise book. ⬆️

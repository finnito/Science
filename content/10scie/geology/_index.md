Assessment Notes:
- send the attached letter home to parents to make sure students are entered for the internal before they start. The letter is also in V:\Science\The SCIENCE file\Year 10\Fire and Fuels\Assessment\Permission & Authenticity Forms
- tick the entry in Kamar as soon as you know who is entering
- enter their grade in Kamar after the assessment and internal moderation is done
- print the grades and get the students to sign them off, then double tick the Kamar entry
- put all student work in PTDs office with the sign-off sheet which should also indicate which student work has been internally moderated.

1. Structure of Earth
    - Core, Outer Core, Mantle, Crust
    - Convection Currents, nuclear reactions, tectonic plate movement
2. Volcanoes
    - Label a diagram
    - Types of volcanoes: shield, cone, caldera, dome + examples a plenty

## Learning Outcomes _/ Ng캐 Wh캐inga Ako_

1. __Earth Structure and Plate Tectonics__
    1. Explain how the earth has changed over 4.6 billion years and  account for its current structure
    2. Explain the theory of plate tectonics using many sources of evidence
    3. Use scientific language:  crust, mantle, outer core, inner core, subduction zone, constructive, destructive and conservative plate boundaries
2. __Earthquakes and Volcanoes__
    1. Use plate tectonics to explain why and where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen
    2. Recall major seismic events from NZ and earth history and relate them to their impact on people
    3. Use scientific language: Richter and Mercalli scale, epicenter, focus, p and s waves, viscosity of larva, shield, dome, caldera
3. __The Rock Cycle__
    1. Describe how sedimentary (including fossils), metamorphic and igneous rocks are created and destroyed
    2. Explain how land features (mountains, rivers, plains) are linked to tectonic plate movement  and erosion and weathering

## Akoranga  Mahi Tuatahi

You may spend 15 minutes working on cutting out, and filling in your flashcards on the first 20 elements!

If you finish that, you may spend the remainder of the time practising with the flashcards 游땎

## Recap: Electrons { .c2 }

![[Source](https://sciencestruck.com/labeled-atom-diagram)](https://www.ibuzzle.com/images/diagrams/atom-diagram/atom-particles1.jpg)

- Negatively charged
- Very small
- Light
- Move fast
- Exist in orbitals/shells around the nucleus of atoms
- In a neutral atom, there are the same number of electrons as protons

---

## Electron Arrangements

- Electrons are behind all chemical reactions
- They can be taken from one atom/molecule and given to another one - thus causing a chemical reaction!
- They go around an atom in shells, but __how many go in each shell__?

---

### {.c2}

- Fill the shells from the inside to the outside!
- Draw electrons as crosses: x
- __First Shell__
    + Can hold up to 2 electrons
- __Second Shell__
    + Can hold up to 8 electrons
- __Third Shell__
    + Can hold up to 18 electrons

### Ngohe/Task

1. Find your worksheet from last class
2. For each element, write the electron configuration:
    + Hint: See the _Carbon_ row!
3. Collect an electron configuration worksheet from the front and draw the diagrams!
    + Hint: Draw electrons as crosses like so: x

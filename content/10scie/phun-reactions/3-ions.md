## Akoranga 5 Mahi Tuatahi

- 10 min: Finish making or practise your flashcards
- 10 min: Complete the electron configuration worksheet

---

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. Can describe why ions form and identify the difference between cations & anions
2. Locate groups 1, 2, 16, 17, 18 elements on the periodic table and identify their number of valence electrons
3. Describe how ionic bonds are formed from the transfer of electrons

<p class="instruction">Write the date and ngā whāinga ako in your book</p>

## Ions {.c2}

> An atom or molecule that has gained or lost electrons, and has become charged.

- Atoms are more _stable_ when they have a full __valence__ (outer) shell
- Atoms with an almost full valence shell will take electrons from other atoms
- Atoms with not many valence electrons will donate electrons to other atoms

### Tauria/Example: Sodium Fluoride {.c2}

![[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bonding)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/NaF.gif)

- Sodium only has one valence electron, and can donate it
- Fluorine is only one electron away from a full shell, so will take one
- Sodium becomes positively charged because it lost an electron
- Fluorine becomes negatively charged because it gained an electron
- They are attracted together and form __sodium fluoride__
- This is called an __ionic bond__ - a bond between ions

### Tauria/Example: Sodium Chloride {.c2}

![[Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ionic_bonding_animation.gif)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Ionic_bonding_animation.gif)

- Sodium only has one valence electron, and can donate it
- Chlorine is only one electron away from a full shell, so will take one
- Sodium becomes positively charged because it lost an electron
- Chlorine becomes negatively charged because it gained an electron
- They are attracted together and form __sodium chloride__

### Which Atoms Form Ions?

- Only atoms in groups 1, 2, 16, and 17 ions
- Groups are vertical columns on the periodic table

<p class="instruction">Open your periodic table an find groups 1, 2, 16 and 17</p>

<p class="instruction">Highlight these columns and add a label saying they will form ions.</p>

---

1. Open to your ionic configuration diagrams
2. Look at the valence shell of groups 1, 2, 16, 17 and 18
3. __Pātai__: What do all the elements in each group have in common?
    - Elements in group 1 have 1 valence electron
    - Elements in group 2 have 2 valence electrons
    - Elements in group 18 have a full valence shell
    - Elements in group 17 are missing 1 electron
    - Elements in group 16 are missing 2 electrons

---

### What is Special About Group 18?

- They have a full valence shell
- This means they do not want to take or give any electrons
- This means they are already very stable
- This means they do not react!

2. What is the formula of the oxide ion?
3. What is the formula of the iron (II) ion?
4. What is the name of the $OH^{-}$ ion?

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. Be able to define _cation_ and _anion_
2. Be able to name ionic compounds

<p class="instruction">Write the date and ngā whāinga ako in your book</p>

---

### Cations

> __Cation__: An atom that has lost electrons to become positively charged

- __Pātai Tahi__: Write three examples of cations using your knowledge of ions
- __Pātai Rua__: Use your periodic table to determine what type of elements form cations

---

### Anions

> __Anion__: An atom that has gained electrons to become negatively charged

- __Pātai Tahi__: Write three examples of anions using your knowledge of ions
- __Pātai Rua__: Use your periodic table to determine what type of elements form anions

## Naming Ionic Compounds

- Ions can join together to form compounds.
- They join in such a way that <mark>their charges cancel out</mark> and <mark>the resulting compound is neutral</mark> (we will practise this later).
- To name an ionic compound:

1. Identify the two ions that make up the compound
2. Write the name of each ion in that same order
3. Hint: The positive ion (metal) will always come first
4. Hint 2: It is important to include the __(II)__ or __(III)__ if it is part of the ion name.

### Whakawai

1. $CaCO_{3}$
    - $Ca^{2+}$ and $CO_{3}^{2-}$ ions $\rightarrow$ Calcium Carbonate
2. $MgSO_{4}$
    - Magnesium Sulfate
3. $Fe(OH)_{2}$
    - Iron (II) Hydroxide
4. $Fe(OH)_{3}$
    - Iron (III) Hydroxide

### More Whakawai

- Collect a sheet from the front.
- This sheet includes every variation of ionic compounds that you should see this year!
- __Answer 20 today__, but you should be able to do all of them before we have a test.

## Forming Ionic Compounds

### When Ions Have Equal Charges

- Some ionic formulae are easy to generate
- This occurs when they have equal and opposite charges. E.g.
    + Potassium Chloride: $K^{+}$ and $Cl^{-1}$.
    + Simply remove the charges and join them together: $KCl$.
    + Magnesium Sulfate: $Mg^{2+} + SO_{4}^{2-} \rightarrow MgSO_{4}$
    + Notice how the charge is removed, but we keep it $O_{4}$! That is because the 4 tells us how many oxygen atoms there is!

### When the Charges are Unequal

Swap and Drop!

1. Remove the sign from the charges (+/-)
2. Swap the numbers between the ions
3. Drop them down to the bottom

|              | __Lithium Oxide__ | __Aluminium Hydroxide__ | __Ammonium Sulphate__ |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| __Charges__  |                   |                         |                       |
| __Swap__     |                   |                         |                       |
| __Drop__     |                   |                         |                       |
| __Compound__ |                   |                         |                       |

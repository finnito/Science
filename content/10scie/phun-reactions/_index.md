## Learning Outcomes _/ Ng캐 Wh캐inga Ako_ 

1. __Atoms and Ions__
    1. Use diagrams to represent the arrangement of protons, neutrons and electrons in atoms
    2. Write electron configurations for the first 20 elements and their ions
    3. Locate groups 1, 2, 16, 17, 18 elements on the periodic table and identify their number of valence electrons
    4. Describe how ions and ionic bonds are formed from the transfer of electron
    5. Identify a covalent compound and explain covalent bond as the sharing of electrons
    6. Use an ion table to write and name simple ionic formulae
2. __Acids and Bases__
    1. Describe the general properties of acids, bases and neutral solutions
    2. Explain the pH scale and use it to determine if a substances is an acid, base, or neutral
    3. Recall that indicators can be used to identify acids & bases
    4. Recall the names and formula for some common acids: $HCl$, $H_{2}SO_{4}$, $HNO_{3}$
    5. Identify the acids and bases from a list of common consumer products
3. __Acid Reactions__
    1. Name the products and write word equations and balanced symbol equations for reactions of acids with bases, carbonate compounds and metals
    2. Give examples of everyday or useful acid reactions
4. __Metals__
    1. Explain the difference between physical and chemical properties of metals
    2. Describe the structure of a metals
    3. Explain how the physical properties of a metal (ie malleability, ductility, lustrous, sonorous) are related to the structure of a metal and its use
    4. Describe where metals and non-metals are found on the periodic table

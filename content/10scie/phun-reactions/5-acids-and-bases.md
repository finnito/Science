## Acids

- Taste sour
- Are red-orange-yellow in _universal indicator_
- pH 0-6
- In lots of citrus fruits
- <mark>$H^{+}$ ions make a solution acidic!</mark>

---

## Bases / Alkali

- Soapy/slippery
- Are blue-purple in _universal indicator_
- pH 8-14
- Used in cleaners commonly
- <mark>$OH^{-}$ ions make a solution basic/alkali!</mark>

---

## Neutral

- In the middle of the scale is _water_
- Water has an equal amount (or no) $H^{+}$ and $OH^{-1}$ ions!
- It is green in _universal indicator_

## Akoranga 16 Mahi Tuatahi

1. What is the name of element $Ne$?
2. What is the atomic number of element $Ca$?
3. How many electrons does the element $C$ have?
4. Draw an electron configuration diagram for an element with 17 electrons
5. What element has 17 electrons?
6. Protons are positive (T/F)
7. Electrons exist inside the nucleus of the atom (T/F)
8. Atoms are neutral overall (T/F)

9. What colours do acids turn universal indicator?
10. What ion causes a solution to be acidic?
11. Water will change the colour of litmus paper (T/F)
12. Sodium hydroxide is an acid (T/F)
13. Give the name of this ionic compound: $CuSO_{4}$
14. Write the formula of _potassium phosphate_
15. Red litmus paper goes blue in the presence of an acid (T/F)

## Common Acids and Bases

- Acids
    + Hydrochloric Acid ($HCl$)
    + Sulphuric Acid ($H_{2}SO_{4}$)
    + Nitric Acids ($HNO_{3}$)
    + Citric Acid (in sour things)
- Bases
    + Sodium Hydroxide ($NaOH$)
    + Potassium Hydroxide ($KOH$)
    + Barium Hydroxide ($Ba(OH)_{2}$)

## Balancing Reactions

- When writing chemical formula, it is important that there are the <mark>same number of each atom on each side of the equation</mark>.

\begin{aligned}
    NaOH + HCl \rightarrow NaCl + H_{2}O
\end{aligned}

- __Pātai__: How many of each atom on each side of the equation?

## Neutralisation Reaction

> A reaction between acid and base is called a neutralisation reaction.

\begin{aligned}
    acid + base &\rightarrow salt + water \newline
    \text{hydrochloric acid} + \text{sodium hydroxide} &\rightarrow \text{sodium chloride} + water \newline
    HCl + NaOH &\rightarrow NaCl + H_{2}O
\end{aligned}

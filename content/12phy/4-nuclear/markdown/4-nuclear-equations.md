## Learning Outcomes

Be able to write equations for these nuclear reactions:

- Alpha decay/radiation/emission
- Beta decay/radiation/emission
- Gamma decay/radiation/emission

---

## Starter

In alpha emission, the decaying atom loses 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

This means taht the atomic nunber of the decaying atom is ________ by ________ and the mass number is ________ by ________.

\begin{align*}
    & {}^{214}_{81}Tl \rightarrow {}^{210}_{79}Au + {}^{4}_{2}He \\
    & {}^{214}_{81}Tl \rightarrow {}^{210}_{79}Au + {}^{4}_{2}\alpha \\
\end{align*}

In a beta emission, a neutron turns into a proton and emits a high-speed electron.

This means that the atomic number of the decay atom is ________ by ________ and the number ________.

\begin{align*}
    & {}^{218}_{84}Po \rightarrow {}^{218}_{85}At + {}^{0}_{-1}e \\
    & {}^{218}_{84}Po \rightarrow {}^{218}_{85}At + {}^{0}_{-1}\beta \\
\end{align*}

---

In a gamma emission, the decaying atom only loses energy, which means it has the same number of protons and neutrons afterwards.

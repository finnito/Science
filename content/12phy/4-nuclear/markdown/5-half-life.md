## Learning Outcomes

- Be able to perform half life calculations

---

## Starter

1. A Carbon-14 nucleus emits a beta particle, then the daughter nucleus also emits a beta particle immediately after. Write down a single nuclear equation for these reactions.
2. An Uranium-241 nucleus emits an alpha particle AND a beta particle. Write down the equation.
3. An atom of Carbon-11 absorbs a neutron. Write down the nuclear equation.

- It is impossible to predict when an unstable/radioactive atom will disintegrate (decay), because the actual timing of the decay is random.
- However, scientists have discovered that different radioactive materials disintegrate at different rates and; they disintegrate exponentially.
- Knowing this, we can predict the proportion of atoms which disintegrate in a particular time.

### Example

A small sample of a radioactive material iodine-131 has been observed for several days while it decayed into xenon-131.

- On the first day, the sample contained 40,000 iodine-131 nuclei.
- Eight days later, the sample only had 20,000 iodine-131 nuclei left.
- Another eight days later, the sample had 10,000 iodine-131 nuclei left.

## Half-Life

- The half-life is the time taken for half of the undecayed atoms in a sample to decay.
- Radioactive materials have unique half-lives.

\begin{align*}
    & A = A_{0} \times (\frac{1}{2})^{\frac{t}{t_{\frac{1}{2}}}}
\end{align*}

- $A$ is the final amount
- $A_{0}$ is the starting amount
- $t$ is elapsed time
- $t$ is half life

The half-life of Hydrogen-3 (Tritium) is approximately 12.25 years. If you found a small sample of Tritium containing 5,000,000 undecayed nuclei, how many undecayed nuclei will there be in the sample after:

1. 12.25 years
2. 24.5 years
3. 49 years
4. 196 years

How long will it take for the sample to have less than 2500 undecayed nuclei left?

You found a 50 g sample of Cobalt-60. The half-life of Cobalt-60 is 5 years.
What would be the mass of the Cobalt-60 sample after 20 years?

1. Calculate how long it would take for the mass of the 50 g sample to fall just below 1.17 g.
2. Sketch a mass vs. time graph of the Cobalt-60 sample over a 30-year period.
3. Use the graph to estimate the mass of the sample after 12.5 years.

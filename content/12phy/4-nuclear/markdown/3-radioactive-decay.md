## Starter

1. Write down the symbol for: __alpha particle__, __beta particle__, and __gamma radiation__ if you know.
2. Describe what an alpha particle consists of.
3. Describe what a beta particle is.

---

## What is a nuclear reaction?

- It is not a physical reaction
- It is not a chemical reaction
- It is a reaction where there is __a change or rearrangement of the nucleons__ in a nucleus

Is it possible to turn copper into gold?

## Three Types of Nuclear Reactions

1. Radioactive decay (alpha, beta, gamma emission)
2. Fusion reaction
3. Fission reaction

### Radioactive Decay

Polonium-211

![](assets/3-pl-211.gif){width=70%}

---

Polonium-211 is an unstable isotope and goes through __alpha decay__ to become a more stable lead-207 isotope. It does this by emitting an alpha particle and energy.

## Alpha Particle

---

### Alpha Radiation (\alpha)

- Helium nuclei (positively charged)
- Made up of two protons and two neutrons
- Slow moving (up to 10% speed of light)
- Short range (up to a few cm)

---

- Least penetration ability (stopped by a sheet of paper)
- Greatest ionizing ability (cause serious harm when ingested)

---

Hydrogen-3

---

Hydrogen-3 goes through beta decay to become a more stable helium-3 atom. It does this by emitting beta particles.

---

### Beta Radiation (\beta)

- High-energy electron (negative charge)
- When emitted, a neutron decays into a proton inside the nucleus
- Can travel up to 90% the speed of light

---

- Medium range: about 30cm
- Medium penetration: can be stopped by a sheet of aluminium about 5mm thick

---

### Gamma Radiation (\gamma)

- Electromagnetic radiation with very high energy
- Occurs as a result of a nucleus being left in a very excited state after undergoing other types of radioactivity
- Fast moving, travels at the speed of light

---

- Has greatest penetration ability: can penetrate through several centimetres of lead
- Has least ionizing ability

What would happen to each radiation type as it enters a magnetic field (coming out of the page) travelling from the left?

## Recall: Diffraction {.c2}

![](https://i2.wp.com/alevelphysics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Figure-1-4.jpg)

- Light diffracts just like sound or matter waves
- The <mark>longer the wavelength, the greater the diffraction</mark>
- Therefore, <mark>red diffracts the most, and blue/purple, the least</mark>.

### Double-Slit vs. Diffraction Gratings

- A double slit has only two openings, while a diffraction grating has thousands of equally spaced openings!
- This increases the amount of interference that is occurring, which makes the fringes narrower
- This is because there is more interference occuring while results is more areas of destructive interference

### Comparing {.c2}

And here you can see how the pattern changes progressivly as more slits are added to a barrier.

## Diffraction Gratings {.c2}

- Instead of having two slits, diffraction gratings often have tens, hundreds or thousands
- <mark>Their spacing is typically extremely small, this means the spacing between fringes is much larger than double-slits</mark>
- <mark>The slits are extremely thin, so the light is diffracted over almost 180 degrees</mark>
- There are a large number of slits, so the fringes are bright
- <mark>In the case of white light, Within each fringe (n) the individual wavelengths are also split up</mark>

### Colours {.c2}

- We should notice, as mentioned before, red light diffracts the most and blue/purple the least. This means for __each fringe__ red is on the outside and blue on the inside.
- For the central white fringe, all the colours have arrived in-phase and with a path difference of 0, therefore they recombine into white light.

## Doing Calculations

- We can still use our equations from before using $n\lambda = dsin(\theta)$
- However, diffraction gratings are typically described like this: _"2000 lines per cm"_. <mark>We need to calculate $d$, slit separation, from this number.</mark>

### Pātai

Calculate the slit separation for a grating with _2000 lines per cm_.

---

#### Whakatika

<div class="answers">
<p>Because there are 2000 lines (gaps) in $1cm$, we can simply divide them to find the distance between each gap.</p>

$$
\begin{aligned}
    d &= \frac{1cm}{2000 lines} \newline
    d &= 5\times10^{-4}cm \newline
    d &= 5\times10^{-6}m
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

---

### Pātai

Calculate the slit separation for a grating with 120,000 lines per $2.5cm$.

---

#### Whakatika

$$
\begin{aligned}
    d &= \frac{2.5cm}{120000 lines} \newline
    d &= 2.083\times10^{-5}cm
\end{aligned}
$$

## Ng훮 Wh훮inga Ako

- Be able to calculate the frequency of beats

### Recall: Interference {.c2}

- When waves intersect each other, they __interfere__. This is where the amplitudes of the waves are combined (add positive and negative amplitudes).
- __Constructive Interference__: When two peaks meet and the resulting amplitude is greater
- __Destructive Interference__: When a peak and a trough meet and the resulting amplitude is less (or in some cases, zero)

## Beats

> A periodic change in __loudness__ of a sound.

- Produced when waves with similar frequencies interfere.
- Waves with different frequencies will slowly change their alignment (phase) over time, thus causing the interference to change.

- Observation 1: The two waves (y1, y2) have a high frequency
- Observation 2: The beat they produce has a much lower frequency

This is due to y1 and y2 being _very_ close in frequency.

## Beat Frequency

For beats to occur we need:

1. The amplitude to be the same
2. The difference in frequency to be small

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{b} &= |f_{2} - f_{1}|
\end{aligned}
$$

### P훮tai Tahi

Zak is standing still and holding a device emitting a frequency of $100Hz$. Josh stands next to him holding a device emitting a frequency of $107Hz$.

__Calculate the frequency of the beats observed by them both.__

#### Whakatika Tahi

This equation $f_{b} = |f_{2} - f_{1}|$ mainly tells us that the beat frequency is the __absolute__ difference between the two frequencies.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{b} &= f_{b} = |f_{2} - f_{1}| \newline
    f_{b} &= |100 - 107| = 7Hz \newline
    f_{b} &= |107 - 100| = 7Hz
\end{aligned}
$$

### P훮tai Rua: Piano Key

Jules is tuning the middle C key on a piano. He is using a tuning fork which produces a frequency of $257Hz$ as a reference. The key is slightly out of tune and a beat frequency of $4Hz$ is heard.

__Calculate the frequency of the out of tune key.__ Note any stumbling blocks you encounter!

#### Whakatika Rua

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{b} &= |f_{2} - f_{1}| \newline
    4 &= 257 - f_{k} = 253Hz \newline
    4 &= f_{k} - 257 = 261Hz
\end{aligned}
$$

On paper we cannot tell which of the frequencies the key should have. In person, someone with a good musical ear could tell if the key is sharp (high) or flat (low).

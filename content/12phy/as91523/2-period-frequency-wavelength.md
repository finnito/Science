## Mahi Tuatahi

The period is very closely linked to the frequency as you can see from their definitions. There is a very simple formula for converting between them:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    T &= \frac{1}{f} \newline
    f &= \frac{1}{T}
\end{aligned}
$$

1. Give the name and unit for $T$ and $f$.
2. Red light has a frequency of $430THz$, what is its period?
3. Microwaves use a type of light with a period of approximately 4.0816327x10^{-10}s. What is its frequency?

## Learning Outcomes

1. Be able to use the frequency-period relationship.
2. Be able to use the wave equation.

## The Wave Equation

We can also relate the __velocity__, __frequency__, and __wavelength__ with the __wave equation__:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    v &= f\lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

<p class="ins">Label each part of this equation with its name and unit.</p>

### PƒÅtai

Mathieu is surfing at Taylors Mistake and decides to count the waves. He notices that 3 waves pass him over 60s.

1. What is the period of the waves?
2. What is the frequency of the waves?
3. A lifeguard measures the velocity of the waves to $300cms^{-1}$. What is their wavelength?

#### Whakatika

1. What is the frequency of the waves?<br/>$f=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{1}{20}=0.05s^{-1}$
2. What is the period of the wave?<br/>$T=\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{0.05}=20s$
3. What is their wavelength?<br/>$v=f\lambda, \lambda=\frac{v}{f}=\frac{3}{0.05}=60m$

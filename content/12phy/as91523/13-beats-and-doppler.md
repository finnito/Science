### Recall: Doppler Shift {.c2}

- __A change in wave frequency due to the motion of emitter or observer__
- Moving towards gives a higher frequency, and away a lower frequency

## Beats Caused by Doppler

- Because movement of a sound source can cause a change of frequency (Doppler effect), this can cause beats to occur.
- For example, two identical devices where one is moving towards/away from the other can cause a slight change in frequency, causing beats to arise.

### PƒÅtai Toru

Both Josh and Zak are holding identical devices emitting a frequency of $100Hz$. Josh sprints away from him again while Zak listens. Zak observes a beat frequency of $3Hz$. The speed of sound is $343ms^{-1}$.

__SHOW that Josh is walking at a speed of $v_{s} = 10.6ms^{-1}$.__

__Step 1__: Calculate $f'$ that Zak is observing from Josh's device ($f_{b} = |f_{2} - f_{1}|$)

__Step 2__: Use this value to find $v_{s}$ in $f' = f\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}$

#### Whakatika Toru a)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{b} &= |f_{2} - f_{1}| \newline
    f &= 103 \text{ or } 97
\end{aligned}
$$

Because Josh is sprinting __away__, the frequency should be lower, so $97Hz$.

#### Whakatika Toru b)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f' &= f \frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}} \text{(+ because away)} \newline
    97 &= 100 \frac{343}{343 + v_{s}} \newline
    \frac{97}{100} &= \frac{343}{343 + v_{s}} \newline
    (343 + v_{s}) \times 0.97 &= 343 \newline
    343 + v_{s} &= \frac{343}{0.97} \newline
    v_{s} &= \frac{343}{0.97} - 343 = 10.6ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

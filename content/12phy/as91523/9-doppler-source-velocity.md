## Mahi Tuatahi

Rearrange $f' = f\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}$ for $v_{s}$ when:

1. Source is approaching the observer
2. Source is retreating from the observer

## Doppler Skill 4: Calculating $v_{s}$ Without $f$

- If you know both $f$, $f'$, and $v_{w}$ you choose the correct version of $f' = f\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}$ and solve.
- If you do not know $f$, but know $f_{approaching}$ and $f_{receeding}$ then __you need to substitute to remove $f$.__
- Unfortunately, $f$ is not the midpoint between $f_{a}$ and $f_{r}$ for the same reason that the average of 1/4 and 1/6 is __not__ 1/5.

To solve, rearrange the dopper formula to make $f$ the subject and then set $f_{approaching} = f_{receeding}$.

We can do this because the __frequency of the source is constant__ (at least in Y12/13 Physics).

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f' &= f\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}} \newline
    f &= f' \frac{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}{v_{w}} \newline\newline
    f_{approaching} &= f_{receeding} \newline
    f_{a} \frac{v_{w} - v_{s}}{v_{w}} &= f_{r} \frac{v_{w} + v_{s}}{v_{w}} \newline
    \text{substitute and solve...}
\end{aligned}
$$

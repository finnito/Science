## Doppler Skill 2: Finding $v_{s}$

This is relatively straightforward when $f$ and $f'$ are known. It becomes more challenging when you do not have both of these variables – we will address this later.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & f' = f\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}
\end{aligned}
$$

1. Identify when you are in a $+$ or a $-$ situtation,
2. Substitute your __knowns__,
3. Simplify and re-arrange to __solve__.

### Pātai: The Airport

Cameron is watching a plane by the airport. Its engines emit sound at $2000Hz$; the speed of sound in air is $330ms^{-1}$.

1. He hears a frequency of $2500Hz$ as it approaches him. What is the velocity of the plane?
2. He hears a frequency of $1250Hz$ as it has passed him. What is the velocity of the plane?

### Pātai: Doppler Ultrasound {.c2}

![](../assets/doppler-ultrasound.png)

- A Doppler ultrasound is used to measure the flow of blood in blood vessels. This can be used to help find blood clots or constricted vessels. The ultrasound operates at $4MHz$ and the speed of sound in flesh/blood is around $1500ms^{-1}$.
- If the return frequency is $4,005,073.09Hz$, __calculate the velocity of the blood towards the device__.

## About the Unit

- Wave Systems
- AS91523
- 4 Credits, Level 3 (External)
- Not in the school exams!
- End of topic test in Term 3 Week 8

---

To start this unit off we are going to spend a week doing some learning about the fundamentals of waves from the Year 12 paper, before moving on to Year 13 specific stuff.

---

## Pātai: What is a wave?

Energy can be transferred from one place to another through either kinetic or electromagnetic waves.

---

### Mechanical Waves

Waves that are vibrations pass through a solid or other medium. Think, the ocean or a slinky.

__NB:__ They __require__ a medium in which to travel.

---

### Electromagnetic Waves

Waves that are part of the electromagnetic spectrum (light, radio waves, infrared, etc).

__NB:__ They __do not require__ a medium in which to travel. Can travel through the vaccuum.

---

The waves that we will be looking at this year have repetition in their motion, and are called __periodic waves__. This periodicity allows us to predict their interactions with relative ease.

---

## Transverse vs Longitudinal Waves

- __Longitudinal:__ The vibration (displacement of particles) is parallel to the direction of motion of the wave (e.g. sound). Think of compression and expansion.
- __Transverse:__ The vibration (displacement of particles) is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the wave (e.g. electromagnetic waves like light).

## Labelling a Wave

__Task:__ Sketch this unlabelled wave into your book on the axis.

![](../assets/transverse-longitudinal.jpg "")

---

- __Peak:__ The highest point on a wave
- __Trough:__ The lowest point on a wave
- __Amplitude (A):__ The distance of greatest displacement from rest on the wave (midpoint to peak, midpoint to trough) (in $m$)
- __Wavelength $\lambda$:__ The distance (in $m$) between consecutive points of idential displacement on the wave (peak to peak, trough to trough, midpoint to midpoint etc.)
- __Compression:__ The point where the particles are most squished together
- __Expansion:__ The point where the particles are most spread out
- __Velocity $v$:__ The velocity (in $ms^{-1}$) of the wave shape

### Period vs. Frequency

- __Period $T$:__ The time taken, in $s$, for one wave to pass any point. For example, a period of 5s means it takes 5 seconds for consecutive peaks to pass a given point.
- __Frequency $f$:__ The number of waves that pass a point in a second, measured in "per second" $s^{-1}$, better known as Hertz $Hz$.

### Ngohe/Task: Period vs Frequency

Collect a sheet each, follow the instructions to sort the statement about period and frequency into columns. Be ready to glue them in!

---

The period is very closely linked to the frequency as you can see from their definitions. There is a very simple formula for converting between them:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    T &= \frac{1}{f} \newline
    f &= \frac{1}{T}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

## The Wave Equation

We can also relate the __velocity__, __frequency__, and __wavelength__ with the __wave equation__:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    v &= f\lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

<p class="ins">Label each part of this equation with its name and unit.</p>

### Pātai

Mathieu is surfing at Taylors Mistake and decides to count the waves. He notices that 3 waves pass him over 60s.

1. What is the frequency of the waves?
2. What is the period of the waves?
3. A lifeguard measures the velocity of the waves to $300cms^{-1}$. What is their wavelength?

---

### Ngohe / Task

Worksheet!

---

### Akoranga 3 Mahi Tuatahi

Red light has a wavelength of approximately $400nm$ and travels at approximately $3\times10^{8}ms^{-1}$.

1. Calculate the frequency of this wavelength light.
2. Calculate the period of this light wave.
2. Explain, in words, what frequency means in this context.

### Interference {.c2}

- When waves intersect each other, they __interfere__. This is where the amplitudes of the waves are combined (add positive and negative amplitudes).
- __Constructive Interference__: When two peaks meet and the resulting amplitude is greater
- __Destructive Interference__: When a peak and a trough meet and the resulting amplitude is less (or in some cases, zero)

![](../assets/interference.gif "")

---

### Nodes and Anti-Nodes

When waves interfere, they combine!

- A __node__ (think: no amplitude) is a place of _minimum_ amplitude (destructive)
- An __anti-node__ is a place of _maximum_ amplitude (constructive)

#### Task/Ngohe

- Worksheet on adding waves

---

## Pulses & Reflection {.c2}

- Wave pulses that travel down a medium can be reflected by a _fixed point_ (e.g. wall).
- The reflected pulse is inverted
- Assuming no $E$ lost to surroundings, the reflected pulse has the same amplitude

---

### Changing Medium Densities

- When pulses arrive at a more dense medium, the speed is reduced
- When a pulse arrives at a less dense medium, the speed is increased
- In both cases, a small amount of energy is _reflected_, and therefore the transmitted amplitude is less

---

### Frequency at Boundaries

- When waves move from one medium to another their _velocity_ changes.
- Waves travel more slowly in dense mediums, and faster in less dense mediums.
- Wavelength is compressed in dense mediums, and expanded in faster mediums.
- <mark>Frequency is __constant__ across mediums</mark>

\begin{aligned}
    f_{thick} &= f_{thin} && \text{Substitute $v=f\lambda$} \newline
    \frac{v_{thick}}{\lambda_{thick}} &= \frac{v_{thin}}{\lambda_{thin}}
\end{aligned}

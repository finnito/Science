### PƒÅtai: [52-hertz Whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52-hertz_whale)

Since the 1980s a single whale has been observed making calls at a frequency of $52Hz$. The whale itself has never been sighted -- only observed through hydrophones. One hydrophone recorded a frequency of $52.1171762Hz$.

_This recording has been sped up 10x to a frequency of approximately $520Hz$._

1. Was the whale moving towards or away from the hydrophone? Justify your answer.
2. Calculate the speed of sound in the water, given a whale feeding speed of approximately $3.35ms^{-1}$

#### Whakatika

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f&=52Hz, f'=52.1171762Hz, v_{s}=3.35ms^{-1} \newline
    f' &= f \frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} - v_{s}} \newline
    52.1171762 &= 52 \frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} - 3.35} \newline
    1.0022534 \times (v_{w} - 3.35) &= v_{w} \newline
    1.0022534v_{w} - 3.35754889 &= v_{w} \newline
    1.0022534v_{w} - v_{w} &= 3.35754889 \newline
    v_{w}(1.0022534 - 1) &= 3.35754889 \newline
    v_{w} &= \frac{3.35754889}{0.0022534} = 1489.99ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}

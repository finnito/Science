## Mahi Tuatahi

A fire engine travelling at a speed of $40ms^{-1}$ sounds a siren of frequency $500Hz$. The speed of sound is $330ms^{-1}$. Calculate the frequency of the observe when:

1. The fire engine is moving directly towards the observer.
2. The fire engine is moving directly away from the observer.
3. Sketch your values onto a rough graph.

## Doppler Skill 5: Offset Doppler Effect {.c2}

![](../assets/offset-doppler.png)

- When the moving object is not directly in line with the observe, we can call this the "offset" or "indirect" Doppler effect.
- <mark>Note: The graph is __not__ symmetrical around 440Hz.</mark>

### Close To The Observer {.c2}

![](../assets/offset-doppler.png)

- When an object passes close by, the velocity of the object relative to the observer does not change until it is very near the observer.
- This has the effect of the frequency changing very rapidly from high to low.

---

### Far From The Observer {.c2}

- The further the moving object is from the observer, the more gradually the frequency changes from high to low as it passes by.
- This is due to the effect of trigonometry on the velocity of the object.

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

Explain the basic structure and wavelength of a standing wave

## Standing Waves

Most musical instruments produce sound through vibration of __standing waves__ in strings or columns of air.

## Waves in a String

1. The particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of the wave,
2. the wave _appears_ to move along the string,
3. the wave is reflected and can travel back and forth

---

- When two identical waves travelling in opposite directions interfere, they can form a standing (stationary) wave.
- No energy is transferred in a standing wave, because the particles are oscillating around a point of equilibrium.
- Peaks and troughs are points of maximum potential energy, and the line of equilibrium is a point of maximum kinetic energy.

## Nodes & Antinodes

- __Node__: A point of __no__ displacement from equilibrium
- __Antinode__: A point of maximum displacement from equilibrium

## Producing Standing Waves

- Because both ends of the string have to be nodes, only certain frequencies will be able to produce standing waves (certain multiples of the wavelength).

## Standing Waves {.c2}

- The length of the string is defined as $L$
- The frequency with the longest wavelength that fits into the string/pipe is called the __fundamental__ (resonant frequency) or __1st harmonic__
- On a string, the fundamental has $\lambda = 2L$

## Question 1

Calculate the fundamental frequency of a string with length 25cm, where the speed of sound is $330ms^{-1}$.

---

\begin{aligned}
    \lambda &= \frac{1}{2} \times 0.25m = 0.125m\\
    f &= v \times \lambda \\
    f &= 330 \times 0.125 = 41.25Hz
\end{aligned}

## Question 2

Calculate the 3rd harmonic for a string with length 25cm where the speed of sound is $330ms^{-1}$.

## Mahi Tuatahi

<p class="instruction">Head up your book with the date.</p>

Quinn strums a ukulele string such that is oscillates at the 3rd harmonic. The string has a length of $30cm$ and the speed of sound is $343ms^{-1}$.

1. Draw a diagram of the harmonic on the string. _Label the nodes and antinodes_.
2. Calculate the wavelength of the harmonic
3. Calculate the frequency of the note emitted
4. Give a reason why the same frequency note played on a trumpet would sound different (with regards to harmonics)

---

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. Explain the modes of resonance of a string in terms of the fundamental vibration and the harmonics
2. Calculate the harmonic frequencies of a string, closed pipe, and open pipe

<p class="instruction">Write the date and ngā whāinga ako in your book</p>

## Musical Wind Instruments

- In order to produce different frequencies in a wind instrument, wind is generally sent past a sharp lip.
- This sharp lip will create a large number of frequencies, but only specific ones will produce standing waves and therefore resonant frequencies.

## Timbre {.c2}

- Different instruments playing the same frequency will produce a different set of harmonics, causing the quality of the note to be quite different.

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

- Be able to calculate the frequency of beats

---

### Recall: Interference {.c2}

- When waves intersect each other, they __interfere__. This is where the amplitudes of the waves are combined (add positive and negative amplitudes).
- __Constructive Interference__: When two peaks meet and the resulting amplitude is greater
- __Destructive Interference__: When a peak and a trough meet and the resulting amplitude is less (or in some cases, zero)

### Nodes and Anti-Nodes

- A __node__ (think: no amplitude) is a place of _minimum_ amplitude
- An __anti-node__ is a place of _maximum_ amplitude

## Beats

- Waves with different frequencies will slowly change their alignment (phase) over time, thus causing the interference to change.
- This changing interference _can_ give rise to periodic changes in volume (amplitude)

## Beat Frequency

For beats to occur we need:

1. The amplitude to be the same
2. The difference in frequency to be small

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & f_{b} = |f_{2} - f_{1}|
\end{aligned}
$$

<mark>This equation is not given to your in your formula sheet.</mark>

### Pātai Tahi

Zak is standing still and holding a device emitting a frequency of $100Hz$. Josh stands next to him holding a device emitting a frequency of $107Hz$.

__Calculate the frequency of the beats observed by them both.__

---

#### Whakatika Tahi

This equation $f_{b} = |f_{2} - f_{1}|$ mainly tells us that the beat frequency is the difference between the two frequencies.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & f_{b} = f_{b} = |f_{2} - f_{1}| \newline
    & f_{b} = 107 - 100 = 7Hz
\end{aligned}
$$

### Pātai Rua: Piano Key

Jules is tuning the middle C key on a piano. He is using a tuning fork which produces a frequency of $257Hz$ as a reference. The key is slightly out of tune and a beat frequency of $4Hz$ is heard.

__Calculate the frequency of the out of tune key.__ Note any considerations you need to have regarding this calculation.

---

#### Whakatika Rua

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{b} &= f_{b} = |f_{2} - f_{1}| \newline
    4 &= 256 - f_{k} = 252Hz \newline
    4 &= 256 + f_{k} = 260Hz
\end{aligned}
$$

On paper we cannot tell which of the frequencies the key should have. In person, with a good musical ear, a person could tell if the key is sharp (high) or flat (low).

## Beats Caused by Doppler

- Because movement of a sound source can cause a change of frequency (Doppler effect), this can cause beats to occur
- For example, two identical devices where one is moving towards/away from the other can cause a slight change in frequency, causing beats to arise

---

### Pātai Toru 

Both Josh and Zak are holding identical devices emitting a frequency of $100Hz$. Josh walks away from him again while Zak listens. Zak observes a beat frequency of $3Hz$. The speed of sound is $343ms^{-1}$.

1. __How fast is Josh walking ($v_{s}$)?__
    a. __Step 1__: Calculate $f'$ that Zak is observing from Josh's device ($f_{b} = |f_{2} - f_{1}|$)
    b. __Step 2__: Use this value to find $v_{s}$ in $f' = f\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}$

---

#### Whakatika Toru a)

\begin{aligned}
    f_{b} &= |f_{2} - f_{1}| \newline
    f &= 103 \text{ or } 97
\end{aligned}

Because Josh is walking __away__, the frequency should be lower, so $90Hz$.

---

#### Whakatika Toru b)

\begin{aligned}
    f' &= f \frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}} \text{(+ because away)} \newline
    97 &= 100 \frac{343}{343 + v_{s}} \newline
    \frac{97}{100} &= \frac{343}{343 + v_{s}} \newline
    (343 + v_{s}) \times 0.97 &= 343 \newline
    343 + v_{s} &= \frac{343}{0.97} \newline
    v_{s} &= \frac{343}{0.97} - 343 = 10.6ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}

## Mahi Tuatahi

Josh is back holding his device. It is now emitting a frequency of $125Hz$, and Zak is running past him. He hears a beat frequency of $5.5Hz$.

1. Calculate the frequency of Zak's device that Josh observes ($f_{b} = f' - f$)
2. Use your answer to calculate how fast Zak is running. ($f' = f \frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}$)

---

### Te Whakatika

\begin{aligned}
    f_{b} &= f' - f \newline
    f_{b} - f &= f' = 130.5Hz \text{ OR } 119.5Hz
\end{aligned}

Because Zak is running __away__, the frequency should be decreased: $f' = 119.5Hz$

---

\begin{aligned}
    f' &= f\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}\newline
    119.5 &= 125 \frac{343}{343 + v_{s}} \newline
    \frac{119.5}{125} &= \frac{343}{343 + v_{s}} \newline
    343 + v_{s} &= \frac{343}{0.956} \newline
    v_{s} &= \frac{343}{0.956} - 343 \newline
    &= 15.7ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}

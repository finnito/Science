## Mahi Tuatahi

With the assistance of a partner, sketch a wave in your book illustrating the peak, trough, amplitude, wavelength and the two equations you can use to do calculations abotut these attributes.

### Interference {.c2}

- When waves intersect each other, they __interfere__. This is where the amplitudes of the waves are combined (add positive and negative amplitudes).
- __Constructive Interference__: When two peaks meet and the resulting amplitude is greater
- __Destructive Interference__: When a peak and a trough meet and the resulting amplitude is less (or in some cases, zero)

### Nodes and Anti-Nodes

When waves interfere, they combine!

- A __node__ (think: __no__ amplitude) is a place of _minimum_ amplitude (destructive)
- An __anti-node__ is a place of _maximum_ amplitude (constructive)

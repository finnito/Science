## The Doppler Effect

- When the frequency of a wave is altered due to __relative motion__ between the object and the observer
- Think: the siren on an ambulance as it drives past!

### A Diagram {.c2}

![](../assets/doppler-effect.png)

- <mark>Describe the wavelength and thus the frequency (pitch) in each location.</mark>
- __In Front__:<br><br>
- __Behind__:<br><br>
- __Perpendicular__:<br><br>

### A Diagram {.c2}

![](../assets/doppler-effect.png)

- __In Front__:<br>The wavelength is compressed: a higher frequency (pitch) is heard.<br>
- __Behind__:<br>The wavelength is expanded/rarefacted: a lower frequency (pitch) is heard.<br>
- __Perpendicular__:<br>The object is neither moving away or towards so the wavelength is not changed, so the wavelength is not changed and the original frequency is heard.<br>

### What is Observed?

- __Sound:__ As a car approaches, the wavefront is compressed and the frequency is increased (pitch increases). As it passes, the wavefront is expanded, the frequency thus decreases (pitch decreases).
- __Light:__ Doppler for light is also known as redshift: a star moving towards us has an increased frequency (bluer light), and a star moving away from us has a decreased frequency (redder light)

### The Equations

- To work with the __Doppler effect__ we will need to be confident using the equations we learned last week!
- If you do not have these equations in your book, copy them down and include the units for each variable.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    v &= f\lambda \newline
    f &= \frac{1}{T}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### PƒÅtai: Speeding Tickets

Police can use radar guns to measure the amount of compression or expansion of the frequency due to the relative motion of the offending car.

1. The gun emits waves with $f=100MHz$. What wavelength is this?
2. The gun reads $f=125MHz$ when the car is approaching. What wavelength is this?
3. The gun reads $f=75MHz$ when the car is receding. What wavelength is this?

## Converting Units

1. Convert $1000m$ into $Mm$
2. Convert $1000m$ into $mm$
3. Convert $1Gm$ into $nm$
4. Convert $620 \mu m$ into $km$
5. Convert $0.012km$ into $nm$

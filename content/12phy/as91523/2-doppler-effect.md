## Mahi Tuatahi

Bodgan is observing a star through a telescope, and it appears to be orange. He looks up the wavelength of orange light and finds it to be around $600nm$.

1. What is the frequency of orange light, given than the speed of light is $c=3 \times 10^{8}ms^{-1}$?
2. Using your value for frequency, what is the period of the orange light?
3. Sketch a wave for this orange light, labelling the wavelength and an arrow indicating the velocity.

## The Doppler Effect

- When the frequency of a wave is altered due to __relative motion__ between the object and the observer
- Think: the siren on an ambulance as it drives past!

### What is Observed?

- __Sound:__ As a car approaches, the wavefront is compressed and the frequency is increased (pitch increases). As it passes, the wavefront is expanded, the frequency thus decreases (pitch decreases).
- __Light:__ Doppler for light is also known as redshift: a star moving towards us has an increased frequency (bluer light), and a star moving away from us has a decreased frequency (redder light)

### The Equations

- To work with the __Doppler effect__ we will need to be confident using the equations we learned last week!
- If you do not have these equations in your book, copy them down and include the units for each variable.

\begin{aligned}
    v &= f\lambda \newline
    f &= \frac{1}{T}
\end{aligned}

#### Pātai Tahi: Speeding Tickets

Police can use radar guns to measure the amount of compression or expansion of the frequency due to the relative motion of the offending car.

1. The gun emits waves with $f=100MHz$. What wavelength is this?
2. The gun reads $f=125MHz$ when the car is approaching. What wavelength is this?
3. The gun reads $f=75MHz$ when the car is receding. What wavelength is this?

## Mahi Tuatahi

1. Convert $1000m$ into $Mm$
2. Convert $1000m$ into $mm$
3. Convert $1Gm$ into $nm$
4. Convert $620 \mu m$ into $km$
5. Convert $0.012km$ into $nm$

### Doppler Equation

\begin{aligned}
    & f' = f\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}
\end{aligned}

- $v_{w}$: the velocity of the wave in the medium
- $v_{s}$: the velocity of the source
- $f$: the __actual__ frequency of the wave produced by the source ($Hz$)
- $f'$: the __observed__ frequency of the wave ($Hz$)

---

#### Pātai: What is the $\pm$ symbol?

- Literally: plus or minus
- In words: $v_{w} \pm v_{s}$ means __the velocity of the wave relative to the source__
- __Approaching__: $-$ because the wave and source are moving in the same direction, <mark>the wave appears to be moving slower relative to the source</mark>
    + Wavefront is compressed, wavelength is shorter, frequency is higher, pitch is higher
- __Receding__: $+$ because the wave and source are moving in opposite directions, <mark>the wave appears to be moving faster relative to the source</mark>
    + Wavefront is expanded, wavelength is longer, frequency is less, pitch is lower

#### Pātai Rua: The Ambulance

A doctor at the hospital hears an ambulance leave the hospital at $30km/h$ and return 15 minutes later at a speed of $35km/h$. Both times its siren is sounding at a frequency of $400Hz$. Sound waves travel at $343ms^{-1}$ in the atmosphere.

1. Calculate the observed frequency as the ambulance leaves.
2. Calculate the observed frequency as the ambulance returns.

### Pātai Toru: The Airport

Cameron is watching a plane by the airport. Its engines emit sound at $2000Hz$; the speed of sound in air is $330ms^{-1}$.

1. He hears a frequency of $2500Hz$ as it approaches him. What is the velocity of the plane?
2. He hears a frequency of $1250Hz$ as it has passed him. What is the velocity of the plane?

#### Pātai Whā: Doppler Ultrasound {.c2}

![](../assets/doppler-ultrasound.png)

- A Doppler ultrasound is used to measure the flow of blood in blood vessels. This can be used to help find blood clots or constricted vessels. The ultrasound operates at $4MHz$ and the speed of sound in flesh/blood is around $1500ms^{-1}$.
- If the return frequency is $4,005,073.09Hz$, __calculate the velocity of the blood towards the device__.

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

- Explain the interference of two wave patterns in terms of nodes, anti-nodes and path difference

---

## Diffraction {.c2}

- When waves pass through an opening or bump against a barrier, they will __diffract__
- __Openings__: The most diffraction occurs when the opening width and wavelength are similar

## {.c2}

- __Barriers__: Longer wavelengths diffract best around barriers e.g. AM radio has a longer wavelength than FM and can be better heard in the mountains
- Notice that the wavelength does not change when diffraction occurs.

## Constructive vs Destructive Interference {.c2}

- Recall the following:
    - __In phase__ waves constructively interfere
    - __Out of phase (180deg)__ waves destructively interfere
    - Waves not exactly (180deg) out of phase partially interfere

## Two Point Source Interference {.c2}

- Two point sources with the same frequency and amplitude are placed near each other
- Their waves will interfere to create points of zero amplitude, and points of 2x amplitude of the original wave

## Interference of Light {.c2}

- For light to interfere we need:
    - Waves of the same frequency
    - Waves with the same amplitude
    - Waves with a stable phase relationship (__coherent__)
* This is usually achieved by passing light from a single source through two _very_ narrow and close slits.

## Path Difference {.c2}

- Moving away from the centre point, the distance each travels becomes unequal
- This means the waves will not keep a constant phase relationship
- We call the difference in the distances that they travel the __path difference__

### Worksheet

- Collect a worksheet
- Fill out the table by counting the number of wavelengths to each point
- Use the table to determine the path difference for each of the anti-nodal lines
- Highlight the statements in the two boxes on the second page
- Finish the rest of the questions on the sheet

---

## Calculating Path Difference {.c2}

- Path difference can be written as $pd$
- __Antinodal Lines__: $pd = n\lambda$
- __Nodal Lines__: $pd = (n - \frac{1}{2})\lambda$

- If you used the equations, verify by counting wavelengths on the diagram.
- If you used the diagram, verify your answer by doing calculations.

## Interference Formula {.c2}

![](../assets/interference-formulation.png)

<!-- <aside class="notes">
1. For the triangle with $\theta$, $tan(\theta)=\frac{y}{D}$
2. For the triangle with $\theta'$, $sin(\theta')=\frac{\delta}{d}$
3. We can say $tan(\theta) \approx sin(\theta) \approx \theta \approx \frac{y}{D}$
</aside> -->

<!-- ## Interference Formula {.c2} -->

<div>
<mark>__Assumption__: The angle $\theta$ is small, therefore $\theta \approx \frac{x}{L}$</mark>

This assumption lets us formulate this equation which we can use to calculate a variety of things:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    pd &= \frac{dx}{L}
\end{aligned}
$$

pd = path difference<br/>
d = distance between the slits<br/>
x = distance of the fringe (bright spot) from the center<br/>
L = distance between slits and screen
</div>

---

### What does it tell us?

$$
\begin{aligned}
    pd &= \frac{dx}{L} \newline
    \text{Rearranging for x and substiting $pd = n\lambda$:} \newline
    x &= \frac{n\lambda L}{d}
\end{aligned}
$$

- as wavelength ($\lambda$) increases, so does the fringe spacing (x)
- as screen distance (L) increases, so does the fringe spacing (x)
- as slit separation (d) increases, the fringe spacing decreases

---

## Interference Formula {.c2}

All this futzing leaves us with a series of formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    pd &= n\lambda \text{ antinodes} \newline
    pd &= (n- \frac{1}{2})\lambda \text{ nodes} \newline
    pd &= \frac{dx}{L} \newline
    \text{OR} \newline
    pd &= dsin(\theta) \newline
    &\text{ \^ assumes } \theta \approx \theta '
\end{aligned}
$$

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

- Explain the interference of two wave patterns in terms of nodes, anti-nodes and path difference

---

## Diffraction {.c2}

- When waves pass through an opening or bump against a barrier, they will __diffract__
- __Openings__: The most diffraction occurs when the opening width and wavelength are similar

## Diffraction {.c2}

- __Barriers__: Longer wavelengths diffract best around barriers e.g. AM radio has a longer wavelength than FM and can be better heard in the mountains
- Notice that the wavelength does not change when diffraction occurs.

## Constructive vs Destructive Interference {.c2}

- Recall the following:
    - __In phase__ waves constructively interfere
    - __Out of phase (180deg)__ waves destructively interfere

## Two Point Source Interference {.c2}

- Two point sources with the same frequency and amplitude are placed near each other
- Their waves will interfere to create points of zero amplitude, and points of 2x amplitude of the original wave

## Interference of Light {.c2}

- For light to interfere we need:
    - Waves of the same frequency
    - Waves with the same amplitude
    - Waves with a stable phase relationship (__coherent__)

## Interference of Light {.c2}

- To interfere light, we usually take a source that produces a single wavelength and pass it through two small slits

## Path Difference

---

## Path Difference

- Moving away from the centre point, the distance each wave travels changes
- This changing difference means that the waves will not keep a constant phase relationship
- We call the difference in the distance they travel the __path difference__

## {.c2}

![](../assets/IMG_1265.jpg)

1. Label the nodal and antinodal lines</li>
2. Determine which of P1, P2, P3 and P4 are nodes and antinodes</li>
3. Count the number of wavelengths that P1, P2, P3, and P4 are from each source</li>
4. Try and determine a general rule for the path difference of notes and antinodes

---

## Calculating Path Difference {.c2}

- Path difference can be written as $pd$
- __Antinodal Lines__: $pd = n\lambda$
- __Nodal Lines__: $pd = (n - \frac{1}{2})\lambda$

## Calculations {.c2}

![](../assets/IMG_1265.jpg)

1. Draw P5 and P6 on a node an antinode
2. Determine whether they are nodes or antinodes
3. Calculate, using the equations, the path difference

- If you used the equations, verify by counting wavelengths on the diagram.
- If you used the diagram, verify your answer by doing calculations.

## Interference Formula {.c2}

![](../assets/interference-formulation.png)

<!-- <aside class="notes">
1. For the triangle with $\theta$, $tan(\theta)=\frac{y}{D}$
2. For the triangle with $\theta'$, $sin(\theta')=\frac{\delta}{d}$
3. We can say $tan(\theta) \approx sin(\theta) \approx \theta \approx \frac{y}{D}$
</aside> -->

<!-- ## Interference Formula {.c2} -->

\begin{aligned}
    \theta &= \frac{x}{L} \text{only for small angles} \newline
    L \theta &= x \newline
    L \frac{pd}{d} &= x \newline
    L pd &= dx \newline
    pd &= \frac{dx}{L} \text{end result}
\end{aligned}

<!-- ![](../assets/interference-formulation.png) -->

<aside class="notes">
$pd = n\lambda$ OR $pd = (n - \frac{1}{2})\lambda$
</aside>

## Interference Formula {.c2}

\begin{aligned}
    pd &= \frac{dx}{L}
\end{aligned}

- $pd$ is path difference (m)
- $d$ is source separation (m)
- $x$ is fringe separation (m)
- $L$ is distance from source to screen (m)

---

## Interference Formula {.c2}

\begin{aligned}
    x = \frac{pdL}{d}
\end{aligned}

- as wavelength increases, so does the spacing (x)
- as L increases, so does the spacing (x)
- as separation increases, the spacing decreases

---

## Interference Formula {.c2}

- Since $d sin(\theta) = pd$
- $pd = n\lambda$ AND $pd = (n - \frac{1}{2})\lambda$
- $d sin(\theta) = n\lambda$ for antinodes
- $d sin(\theta) = (n-\frac{1}{2})\lambda$ for nodes

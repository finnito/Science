## Ngā Whāinga Ako

- Be able to calculate the frequency of beats

### Recall: Interference {.c2}

- When waves intersect each other, they __interfere__. This is where the amplitudes of the waves are combined (add positive and negative amplitudes).
- __Constructive Interference__: When two peaks meet and the resulting amplitude is greater
- __Destructive Interference__: When a peak and a trough meet and the resulting amplitude is less (or in some cases, zero)

---

### Recall: Doppler Shift {.c2}

- __A change in wave frequency due to the motion of emitter or observer__
- Moving towards gives a higher frequency, and away a lower frequency

## Beats

> A periodic change in __loudness__ of a sound.

- Produced when waves with similar frequencies interfere.
- Waves with different frequencies will slowly change their alignment (phase) over time, thus causing the interference to change.

## Beat Frequency

For beats to occur we need:

1. The amplitude to be the same
2. The difference in frequency to be small

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{b} &= |f_{2} - f_{1}|
\end{aligned}
$$

### Pātai Tahi

Zak is standing still and holding a device emitting a frequency of $100Hz$. Josh stands next to him holding a device emitting a frequency of $107Hz$.

__Calculate the frequency of the beats observed by them both.__

---

#### Whakatika Tahi

This equation $f_{b} = |f_{2} - f_{1}|$ mainly tells us that the beat frequency is the __absolute__ difference between the two frequencies.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{b} &= f_{b} = |f_{2} - f_{1}| \newline
    f_{b} &= |100 - 107| = 7Hz \newline
    f_{b} &= |107 - 100| = 7Hz
\end{aligned}
$$

### Pātai Rua: Piano Key

Jules is tuning the middle C key on a piano. He is using a tuning fork which produces a frequency of $257Hz$ as a reference. The key is slightly out of tune and a beat frequency of $4Hz$ is heard.

__Calculate the frequency of the out of tune key.__ Note any stumbling blocks you encounter!

---

#### Whakatika Rua

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{b} &= |f_{2} - f_{1}| \newline
    4 &= 257 - f_{k} = 253Hz \newline
    4 &= f_{k} - 257 = 261Hz
\end{aligned}
$$

On paper we cannot tell which of the frequencies the key should have. In person, someone with a good musical ear could tell if the key is sharp (high) or flat (low).

## Beats Caused by Doppler

- Because movement of a sound source can cause a change of frequency (Doppler effect), this can cause beats to occur
- For example, two identical devices where one is moving towards/away from the other can cause a slight change in frequency, causing beats to arise

---

### Pātai Toru

Both Josh and Zak are holding identical devices emitting a frequency of $100Hz$. Josh walks away from him again while Zak listens. Zak observes a beat frequency of $3Hz$. The speed of sound is $343ms^{-1}$.

__SHOW that Josh is walking at a speed of $v_{s} = 10.6ms^{-1}$.__

__Step 1__: Calculate $f'$ that Zak is observing from Josh's device ($f_{b} = |f_{2} - f_{1}|$)

__Step 2__: Use this value to find $v_{s}$ in $f' = f\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}$

---

#### Whakatika Toru a)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{b} &= |f_{2} - f_{1}| \newline
    f &= 103 \text{ or } 97
\end{aligned}
$$

Because Josh is walking __away__, the frequency should be lower, so $90Hz$.

---

#### Whakatika Toru b)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f' &= f \frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}} \text{(+ because away)} \newline
    97 &= 100 \frac{343}{343 + v_{s}} \newline
    \frac{97}{100} &= \frac{343}{343 + v_{s}} \newline
    (343 + v_{s}) \times 0.97 &= 343 \newline
    343 + v_{s} &= \frac{343}{0.97} \newline
    v_{s} &= \frac{343}{0.97} - 343 = 10.6ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

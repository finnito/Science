## Learning Outcomes

Explain the basic structure and wavelength of a standing wave

## Standing Waves

Most musical instruments produce sound through vibration of __standing waves__ in strings or columns of air

## Waves in a String

1. The particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of the wave,
2. the wave _appears_ to move along the string,
3. the wave is reflected and can travel back and forth

- When two identical waves travelling in opposite directions interfere, they can form a standing (stationary) wave.
- No energy is transferred in a standing wave, because the particles are oscillating around a point of equilibrium.
- Peaks and troughs are points of maximum potential energy, and the line of equilibrium is a point of maximum kinetic energy.

## Nodes & Antinodes

- __Node__: A point of __no__ displacement from equilibrium
- __Antinode__: A point of maximum displacement from equilibrium

## Producing Standing Waves

- Because both ends of the string have to be nodes, only certain frequencies will be able to produce standing waves.

## Standing Waves {.c2}

- The length of the string is defined as $L$
- The frequency with the longest wavelength that fits into the string/pipe is called the __fundamental__ or __1st harmonic__
- On a string, the fundamental has $\lambda = 2L$

### Harmonics {.c2}

- We can calculate the harmonic wavelength & frequency using these relationships:

\begin{align*}
    \lambda &= \frac{\lambda_{fundamental}}{\text{harmonic number}} \\
    f &= f_{fundamental} \times \text{harmonic number}
\end{align*}

---

## Question 1

Calculate the fundamental frequency of a string with length 25cm, where the speed of sound is $330ms^{-1}$.

---

\begin{align*}
    \lambda &= \frac{1}{2} \times 0.25m = 0.125m\\
    f &= v \times \lambda \\
    f &= 330 \times 0.125 = 41.25Hz
\end{align*}

---

## Question 2

Calculate the 3rd harmonic for a string with length 25cm where the speed of sound is $330ms^{-1}$.

## Learning Outcomes

- Be able to calculate the frequency of beats
- Be able to calculate the velocity of a source using the beat frequency

---

## Sound Recap

- Recall that sound is the compression and rarefaction of air causing your eardrum to vibrate and you to hear sound!
- When compression (peak) meets compression, their amplitudes are combined (__constructive interference__)
- and when rarefaction (trough) meets compression, their amplitudes cancel out (__destructive interference__)

## Beats

By changing the position of the waves over time, we can cause the interference to change.

This changing interference _can_ give rise to periodic changes in volume (amplitude)

### Beat Frequency

For beats to occur we need:

1. The amplitude to be the same
2. The difference in frequency to be small

\begin{align*}
    & f_{b} = f_{2} - f_{1}
\end{align*}

This equation is not given to your in your formula sheet. $f_{2}$ should be the larger of the two.

---

#### Example Calculation

Zak is standing still and holding a device emitting a frequency of $100Hz$. Josh stands next to him holding a device emitting a frequency of $107Hz$.

Calculate the frequency of the beats observed them both.

---

##### Answer

This equation $f_{b} = f_{2} \pm f_{1}$ mainly tells us that the beat frequency is the difference between the two frequencies.

\begin{align*}
    & f_{b} = f_{2} \pm f_{1} \newline
    & f_{b} = 107 - 100 = 7Hz
\end{align*}

### Question: Piano Key

Jules is tuning the middle C key on a piano. He is using a tuning fork which produces a frequency of $257Hz$ as a reference. The key is slightly out of tune and a beat frequency of $4Hz$ is heard.

Calculate the frequency of the out of tune key.

---

#### Answer

\begin{align*}
    & f_{b} = f_{2} - f_{1} \newline
    & 4 = 256 - f_{k} = 252Hz \newline
    & 4 = 256 + f_{k} = 260Hz
\end{align*}

On paper we cannot tell which of the frequencies the key should have. In person, with a good musical ear, a person could tell.

---

Josh changes his device to be $100Hz$, the same as Zak. He walks away him again while Anton listens. Anton observes a beat frequency of $10Hz$. The speed of sound is $343ms^{-1}$.

1. __How fast is Josh walking ($v_{s}$)?__
    1. Calculate $f'$ that Anton is observing from Josh's device ($f_{b} = f_{2} \pm f_{1}$)
    2. Use this value to find $v_{s}$ in $f' = f\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}$

---

\begin{align*}
    f_{b} &= f_{2} - f_{1} \newline
    f &= 110 \text{ or } 90
\end{align*}

Because Josh is walking __away__, the frequency should be lower, so $90Hz$.

---

\begin{align*}
    f' &= f \frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}} \text{ add because away} \newline
    90 &= 100 \frac{343}{343 + v_{s}} \newline
    \frac{90}{100} &= \frac{343}{343 + v_{s}} \newline
    (343 + v_{s}) \times 0.9 &= 343 \newline
    343 + v_{s} &= \frac{343}{0.9} \newline
    v_{s} &= \frac{343}{0.9} - 343 = 38.11ms^{-1}
\end{align*}

## Mahi Tuatahi

Josh is back holding his device. It is now emitting a frequency of $125Hz$, and Zak is running past him. He hears a beat frequency of $5.5Hz$.

1. Calculate the frequency of Zak's device that Josh observes ($f_{b} = f' - f$)
2. Use your answer to calculate how fast Zak is running. ($f' = f \frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}$)

---

### Answer

\begin{align*}
    f_{b} &= f' - f \newline
    f_{b} - f &= f' = 130.5Hz \text{ OR } 119.5Hz
\end{align*}

Because Zak is running __away__, the frequency should be decreased: $f' = 119.5Hz$

---

\begin{align*}
    f' &= f\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \pm v_{s}}\newline
    119.5 &= 125 \frac{343}{343 + v_{s}} \newline
    \frac{119.5}{125} &= \frac{343}{343 + v_{s}} \newline
    343 + v_{s} &= \frac{343}{0.956} \newline
    v_{s} &= \frac{343}{0.956} - 343 \newline
    &= 15.7ms^{-1}
\end{align*}

## What is Energy?

> Energy is a quantity that must be transferred/transformed to do __work__.

- __Pātai__: What is energy measured in?
- __Whakatika__: Joules (J)

> Work is the amount of energy trasferred or transformed (J).

---

### The Different Forms of Energy

- Light
- __Heat__
- __Sound__
- Electrical
- Radiation
- __Kinetic__
- Nuclear potential
- Chemical potential
- __Gravitational potential__
- __Elastic potential__

---

## Law of Conservation of Energy

> Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can only be __transformed__ or __transferred__.

<mark>This tells us that: __the total energy in a system is always conserved__.</mark> The system might be a collision/explosion, a beaker, Earth or the whole Universe!

### Seeing it in Action

- For example, in [this simulation](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/energy-skate-park-basics/latest/energy-skate-park-basics_en.html), the skater will never go higher than they started.
- This is because they cannot _get_ extra energy from the surroundings.
- In a frictionless world, they will also reach the same height because no energy is lost to the surroundings!

## Kinetic Energy

> The energy that a moving object has. Related to its velocity and mass.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & E_{k} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} \cr
    & \text{m = mass of the moving object} \cr
    & \text{v = speed of the moving object}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

## Gravitational Potential Energy

> Energy an object has by being displaced from _ground_ in a gravitational field. Related to its mass and height.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & E_{p} = mg \Delta h \cr
    & \text{m = mass of the object} \cr
    & \text{g = acceleration due to gravity } 9.8ms^{-2} \downarrow \cr
    & \text{h = height of the object}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

## Combining Gravitational and Kinetic Energy

When an object falls from a height, its __gravitational potential energy__ is transformed into __kinetic energy__, but, the total energy in the system is __constant__.

_In the real world some energy is lost due to friction as heat, light or sound. In the ideal world 100% of the energy is transformed._

In an __ideal__ world we say:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E_{total} &= E_{k} + E_{p} \cr
    E_{k} &= E_{p} && \text{they are equal} \cr
    \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} &= m g \Delta h && \text{substitute in the equations} \cr
\end{aligned}
$$

### Pātai: The Sandbag

A bullet of mass $30g$ is fired with a speed of $400ms^{-1}$ into a sandbag. The sandbag has a mass of $10kg$ and is suspended by a rope so that it can swing.

1. Find the kinetic energy of the bullet
2. Find the height that the sandbag + bullet could rise

---

#### Te Whakatika

__Step 1.__ Find kinetic energy of the bullet

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & E_{k} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} \cr
    & E_{k} = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.03 \times 400^{2} && \text{substitute values} \cr
    & E_{k} = 2,400J
\end{aligned}
$$

---

__Step 2.__ Equate this with potential energy of sandbag & bullet

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E_{total} &= E_{k} + E_{p} \cr
    E_{k} &= E_{p} && \text{they are equal} \cr
    E_{k} &= m g \Delta h \cr
    2400 &= 10.03 \times 9.8 \times \Delta h && \text{substitute values} \cr
    2400 &= 98.294h \cr
    \Delta h &= \frac{2400}{98.294} \cr
    \Delta h &= 24.41m
\end{aligned}

## Elastic Potential Energy

> A spring displaced from equilibrium will store some potential energy (to return to equilibrium).

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & E_{p} = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2} \cr
    & \text{k = spring constant} \cr
    & \text{x = spring compression/stretch (displacement)}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- TODO: Add gif of spring extension/compression -->

The spring constant (k) is a measure of the stiffness of the spring.

---

## Hooke's Law

We can relate the displacement of a spring to its spring constant and the force required to create the displacement using __Hooke's Law__.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F &= -kx && \text{Force exerted by spring} \cr
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- TODO: Make diagram illustrating these forces -->

- The $-$ indicates that the restoring force and the displacement are in opposite directions.
- $F$: the force displacing the spring (Newtons)
- $x$: the displacement of the spring (meters)
- $k$: the spring constant ($Nm^{-1}$)

### Pātai Toru (Q3): Aeroplane

$$

$$

## Work

> The amount of energy transferred/transformed (Joules, J).

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & W = Fd \cr
    & work = force \times distance
\end{aligned}
$$

---

- Consider moving an object through a gravitational field
- You have to exert a force against a __weight force__, to lift it some distance

$$
\begin{aligned}
    W &= F_{w}d \cr
    W &= (m \times g) d \cr
    W &= mgh
\end{aligned}
$$

---

- Work is done __only__ when energy is transferred or transformed.
- __Work Done__: Lifting an object and placing it on a shelf transfers energy to that object into the form of gravitational potential energy.
- __No Work Done__: Moving an object horizontally where it starts and finishes with $v=0ms^{-1}$.
- Work only depends on the _start_ and _finish_ position, the path does not matter (path independence).

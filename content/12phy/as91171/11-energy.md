### Whakatika 1

__How long does it take for the ball to reach its highest point?__<br>Think in the $y-direction$!

\begin{aligned}
    & v_{i} = 44.8ms^{-1}, v_{f} = 0ms^{-1}, a = -9.8ms^{-2} && \text{(K)}  \newline
    & t = ? && \text{(U)} \newline
    & v_{f} = v_{i} + at && \text{(F)} \newline
    & 0 = 44.8 + (-9.8)t && \text{(S+S)} \newline
    & \frac{-44.8}{-9.8} = t = 4.57s
\end{aligned}

---

### Whakatika 2

__How high does the ball rise?__<br>Think in the $y-direction$!

\begin{aligned}
    & v_{i} = 44.8ms^{-1}, v_{f} = 0ms^{-1}, a = -9.8ms^{-2} && \text{(K)}  \newline
    & d = ? && \text{(U)} \newline
    & v_{f}^{2} = v_{i}^{2} + 2ad && \text{(F)} \newline
    & 0^{2} = 44.8^{2} + 2(-9.8)d && \text{(S+S)} \newline
    & \frac{-2007.04}{2\times-9.8} = d = 102.4m
\end{aligned}

## What is Energy?

> Energy is a quantity that must be transferred/transformed to do __work__.

- __Pātai__: What is energy measured in?
- __Whakatika__: Joules (J)

---

### The Different Forms of Energy

- Light
- __Heat__
- __Sound__
- Electrical
- Radiation
- __Kinetic__
- Nuclear potential
- Chemical potential
- __Gravitational potential__
- __Elastic potential__

---

## Law of Conservation of Energy

> Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can only be __transformed__ or __transferred__.

<mark>This tells us that: __the total energy in the system is always conserved__.</mark> The system might be a collision/explosion, a beaker, Earth or the whole Universe!

### Seeing it in Action

- For example, in [this simulation](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/energy-skate-park-basics/latest/energy-skate-park-basics_en.html), the skater will never go higher than they started.
- This is because they cannot _get_ extra energy from the surroundings.
- In a frictionless world, they will also reach the same height because no energy is lost to the surroundings!

---

### What Energy Do We Care About?

- Kinetic
- Gravitational potential
- Elastic potential

---

## Kinetic Energy

> The energy that a moving object has. Related to its velocity and mass.

\begin{aligned}
    & E_{k} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} \newline
    & \text{m = mass of the moving object} \newline
    & \text{v = speed of the moving object}
\end{aligned}

---

## Gravitational Potential Energy

> Energy an object has by being displaced from _ground_ in a gravitational field. Related to its mass and height.

\begin{aligned}
    & E_{p} = mg \Delta h \newline
    & \text{m = mass of the object} \newline
    & \text{g = acceleration due to gravity } 9.8ms^{-2} \downarrow \newline
    & \text{h = height of the object}
\end{aligned}

---

## Combining Gravitational and Kinetic Energy

When an object falls from a height, its __gravitational potential energy__ is transformed into __kinetic energy__, but the total energy in the system is __constant__.

In the real world some energy is lost due to friction as heat, light or sound. In the ideal world 100% of the energy is transformed.

Therefore when comparing an object at the top of its fall, to the bottom of its fall we can say:

\begin{aligned}
    & E_{total} = E_{k} + E_{p} \newline
    & E_{k} = E_{p} && \text{they are equal} \newline
    & \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} = m g \Delta h && \text{substitute in the equations} \newline
\end{aligned}

---

### Pātai Tahi (Q1): The Sandbag

A bullet of mass $30g$ is fired with a speed of $400ms^{-1}$ into a sandbag. The sandbag has a mass of $10kg$ and is suspended by a rope so that it can swing.

Calculate the maximum height that the sandbag rises as it recoils with the bullet lodged inside.

---

#### Whakatika Tahi

__Step 1.__ Find kinetic energy of the bullet

\begin{aligned}
    & E_{k} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} \newline
    & E_{k} = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.03 \times 400^{2} && \text{substitute values} \newline
    & E_{k} = 2,400J
\end{aligned}

---

__Step 2.__ Equate this with potential energy of sandbag & bullet

\begin{aligned}
    E_{total} &= E_{k} + E_{p} \newline
    E_{k} &= E_{p} && \text{they are equal} \newline
    E_{k} &= m g \Delta h \newline
    2400 &= 10.03 \times 9.8 \times h && \text{substitute values} \newline
    2400 &= 98.294h \newline
    \Delta h &= \frac{2400}{98.294} \newline
    \Delta h &= 24.41m
\end{aligned}

2. Be able to use Hooke's Law ($F=-kx$)

## Elastic Potential Energy

> A spring displaced from equilibrium will store some potential energy (to return to equilibrium).

\begin{aligned}
    & E_{p} = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2} \newline
    & \text{k = spring constant} \newline
    & \text{x = spring compression/stretch (displacement)}
\end{aligned}

- The spring constant is a measure of the stiffness of the spring.
- Low constant $\rightarrow$ easy to displace
- High constant $\rightarrow$ difficult to displace

---

## Hooke's Law

We can relate the displacement of a spring to its spring constant and the force required to create the displacement using __Hooke's Law__.

\begin{aligned}
    F &= -kx && \text{Force exerted by spring} \newline
    F &= kx && \text{Force creating the displacement} \newline
\end{aligned}

- $F$: the force displacing the spring (Newtons)
- $x$: the displacement of the spring (meters)
- $k$: the spring constant ($Nm^{-1}$)

### Pātai Toru (Q3): Aeroplane

It halves the amount that the spring extends, and reduces the amount of energy stored by a lot.

\begin{aligned}
    & E_{p} = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2} \newline

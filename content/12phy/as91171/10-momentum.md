## Momentum

Momentum is a quantity of an object which involves its __mass__ and __velocity__.
It can be thought of as the __oomph__ of an object, or how hard it is to change its direction.

\begin{aligned}
    & p = mv \newline
    & momentum = mass \times velocity \newline
\end{aligned}

---

### Pātai Tahi (Q1)

Using the equation

\begin{aligned}
    & p = mv \newline
    & momentum = mass \times velocity \newline
\end{aligned}

what are the units for momentum?

---

#### Whakatika Tahi

\begin{aligned}
    & p = mv \newline
    & momentum = mass \times velocity \newline
    & momentum = kgms^{-1}
\end{aligned}

---

### Pātai Rua: Scalar or Vector?

- __Momentum is a vector__ quantity because it depends upon a vector (_velocity_).
- Momentum is always in the direction of the objects velocity.

---

### Where is it Used?

Momentum is very useful when considering collisions and explosions. Most questions you will see will involve collisions. It helps us describe and understand why objects move how they do after collisions.

    &  && \text{(U)} \newline
    &  && \text{(F)} \newline

    & p = ? && \text{(U)} \newline
    & p = mv && \text{(F)} \newline
    & p = 30,000,000 \times 0.2 = 6,000,000kgms^{-1} && \text{(S + S)} 
\end{aligned}

---

## Change in Momentum (1D)

When a force acts upon an object and its motion changes, its momentum will also change. We call change in momentum $\Delta p$.

\begin{aligned}
    & \Delta p = p_{f} - p_{i} \newline
    & \Delta p = \text{final momentum} - \text{initial momentum}
\end{aligned}

- In 1D we can use this equation directly
- In 2D we use this equation to help us draw a vector diagram, and then we use trigonometry

## Impulse

> In order to cause a change in momentum, a force must act upon an object for some amount of time. This is called __impulse__.

\begin{aligned}
    & F = ma \newline
    & F = m \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}  && \text{substituting for acceleration} \newline
    & F = m \frac{(v_{f} - v_{i})}{\Delta t} && \text{expanding }\Delta v \newline
    & F \Delta t = m (v_{f} - v_{i}) && \text{multiply by }\Delta t \newline
    & F \Delta t = mv_{f} - mv_{i} && \text{expand brackets} \newline
    & F \Delta t = \Delta p
\end{aligned}

### Pātai Whitu (Q7): Satellite in Orbit

A satellite is in orbit. It weighs $300kg$ and it has a thruster which exerts a force of $1500N$. How long must the satellite fire its thruster for if it wants to increase its speed from $5000ms^{-1}$ to $6000ms^{-1}$?

__Hint:__ Calculate $\Delta p$ first using the velocities, then use the inpulse relationships.

---

#### Whakatika {.c2}

\begin{aligned}
    \Delta p &= mv_{f} - mv_{i} \newline

## Akoranga 34 Mahi Tuatahi

Lena is swinging a bucket of water in a circle around her head to demonstrate circular motion. The length of the rope is $0.75m$ and it takes $0.84s$ to go around.

1. Explain why the bucket is always accelerating. __(A)__
2. Calculate the acceleration of the bucket. __(M)__
3. Name the force that causes the bucket to accelerate as it goes around her head. Explain why the force causes the bucket to accelerate and follow a circular path. __(M)__

---

### Whakatika

1. Explain why the bucket is always accelerating. __(A)__<br>The bucket is always accelerating because it is always changing direction, which means the velocity is always changing.

---

2. Calculate the acceleration of the bucket. __(M)__

\begin{aligned}
    & a_{c} = \frac{v^{2}}{r} \newline
    & a_{c} = \frac{(\frac{(2 \pi r)}{T})^{2}}{r} && \text{substitute } v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T} \newline
    & a_{c} = \frac{(\frac{(2 \pi 0.75)}{0.84})^{2}}{0.75} && \text{substitute values} \newline
    & a_{c} = \frac{31.47}{0.75} \newline
    & a_{c} = 42ms^{-2}
\end{aligned}

---

3. Name the force that causes the bucket to accelerate as it goes around her head. Explain why the forces cause the bucket to accelerate. __(M)__

__Centripetal force__

Centripetal force causes the bucket to accelerate because it acts as a tension force towards the center of the circle. The force acts at a right angle to the motion of the bucket, therefore causing it to change direction continuously towards the center of the circle.

## Conservation of Momentum

- Momentum is conserved during collisions between objects and in explosions.
    + $p_{i} = p_{f}$
- <mark>Conservation of momentum only occurs when __no external forces are present__</mark>.
    + An external force would change the momentum ($F \Delta t = \Delta p$)!
- For example, gravity or friction either do not apply or have been cancelled by reaction forces.
- <mark>__Conservation of momentum__ is the only way to solve collision problems</mark>
- Energy is not usually conserved and therefore cannot be used.

## Conservation of Momentum in 1D

- The most straightforward problem you will see is conservation of momentum in 1-dimension. We will use subscript $1$ and $2$ to indicate object $1$ and $2$.
- So that we do not get confused about the velocities, we will also use $u$ to indicate initial velocities and $v$ to indicate final velocities.
- This is an equation representing a collision between two objects.

\begin{aligned}
    p_{i} &= p_{f} \newline
    p_{1i} + p_{2i} &= p_{1f} + p_{2f} \newline
    m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} &= m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2} \newline
\end{aligned}

## Collisions: Elastic vs. Inelastic

- __Q.__ Can we use energy to calculate collisions?
- __A.__ No, because <mark>energy is lost due to friction, meaning that __total kinetic energy is not conserved__.</mark>
- However, <mark>in __elastic collisions__ total kinetic energy is conserved.</mark>
- \sum E_{ki} = \sum E_{kf}
- __NB:__ If total kinetic energy is not conserved, the collision is __inelastic.__ <mark>Most collisions are inelastic.</mark>

### Pātai Iwa (Q9): The Rifle

Jordan is out clay pigeon shooting over the weekend and notices that the gun recoils when he fires. His rifle has mass $4kg$ and fires a bullet of mass $20g$ at $400ms^{-1}$. What is the recoil speed of the rifle into his shoulder?

__Hint:__ Think carefully about the initial speed of both the rifle and bullet before firing.

\begin{aligned}
    \text{(K)} \newline
    \text{(U)} \newline
    \text{(F)} \newline
    \text{(S+S)} 
\end{aligned}

---

#### Whakatika

Both the bullet and the rifle are stationary beforehand. Therefore $u_{1}$ and $u_{2} = 0$.

\begin{aligned}
    p_{i} &= p_{f} \text{ assuming }F_{net} = 0 \newline
    m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} &= m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2} \newline
    m_{1} \times 0 + m_{2} \times 0 &= m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2}  && u_{1}=u_{2}=0 \newline
    0 &= (4 \times v_{1}) + (0.02 \times 400) \newline
    0 &= 4v_{1} + 8 \newline
    -8 &= 4v_{1} \newline
    \frac{-8}{4} &= v_{1} = -2ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}

#### Whakatika

##  1. What quantity is conserved during the collision? __(A)__

_Momentum is conserved_

---

2. Calculate the __size__ and __direction__ of the car's momentum change. __(E)__

\begin{aligned}
    & \Delta p = p_{f} - p_{i} \newline
    & \Delta p = mv_{f} - mv_{i} && \text{substituting } p = mv\newline
    & \Delta p = (950 \times 2) - (950 \times 8) && \text{substitute values} \newline
    & \Delta p = 1900 - 7600 \newline
    & \Delta p = -5700Nm
\end{aligned}

---

3. Calculate the speed of the van immediately after the collision. __(M)__

_The van is stationary before the collision._ $u_{2}=0$

\begin{aligned}
    & m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} = m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2} \newline
    & m_{1}u_{1} = m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2}  && u_{2}=0 \newline
    & 950 \times 8 = (950 \times 2) + (1700 \times v_{2})  && \text{substitute values} \newline
    & 7600 = 1900 + 1700 v_{2} \newline
    & 5700 = 1700 v_{2} && \text{subtract 1900 from both sides} \newline
    & v_{2} = \frac{5700}{1700} && \text{divide through by 1700} \newline
    & v_{2} = 3.35ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}

---

4. If the average force that the van exerts on the car is $3800N$, calculate how long the collision lasts. __(A)__

_The van exerts a force on the car that slows it down. Therefore the force is against the direction of motion, and therefore negative._

\begin{aligned}
    & F \Delta t = \Delta p \newline
    & -3800 \times \Delta t = -5700 && \text{substitute values} \newline
    & \Delta t = \frac{-5700}{-3800} && \text{divide through by -3800} \newline
    & \Delta t = 1.5s
\end{aligned}

---

5. The driver has a bag resting on the passenger seat during the collision. Explain why the bag fell to the floor during the collision. __(E)__

During the collision the van exerts a force upon the car to slow it down. This force acts over a duration of 1.5s. For a force to act upon an object it needs to be attached to or part of the object. A seatbelt attaches the driver to the car allowing the force to act upon the driver through the seatbelt to change their momentum.

Because the bag is not attached to the car the force cannot change its momentum, and it continues to move forward even as the car slows down. This causes it to leave the seat and fall to the ground.

---

6. The front of modern cars are designed to crumple upon impact. Explain why this is beneficial to people in the car. __(E)__

Whether or not a car has a crumple zone, the same change in momentum will occur because of the same change in motion. Using the impulse equation $F \Delta t = \Delta p$ we can see that by increase the time taken for the collision to occur, a smaller force is necessary. This smaller force means that less force affects the driver of the car and therefore reduces the risk of injury.

### Pātai Tekau mā Rua (Q12)

A Morris Minor car ($m=750kg$) is travelling at $30ms^{-1}$ and collides head on with a Mercedes Benz car ($m=1600kg$) travelling at $20ms^{-1}$ in the opposite direction. The two cars __lock together__ in the crash.

1. Calculate the total momentum
2. Calculate the velocity on the combined wreckage after the collision
3. Would the wreckage keep moving at this velocity? Why or why not?

---

#### Whakatika

1. Calculate the total momentum

_Because momentum is conserved, we can calculate the total momentum before OR after the collision._

\begin{aligned}
    & \sum p = p_{1} + p_{2} && \text{sum momentum of two objects} \newline
    & \sum p = m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} && \text{subsititute } p = mv \newline
    & \sum p = (750 \times 30) + (1600 \times -20) && \text{Benz has negative velocity (opposite direction)} \newline
    & \sum p = 22500 - 32000 \newline
    & \sum p = -9500Nm 
\end{aligned}

---

2. Calculate the velocity on the combined wreckage after the collision

\begin{aligned}
    & \sum p_{i} = \sum p_{f} \newline
    & p_{1} + p_{2} = p_{3} && \text{vehicles locked together afterwards} \newline
    & m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} = m_{3}v_{3} && \text{substitute } p = mv \newline
    & -9500 = 2350v_{3} && \text{using total momentum from previous} \newline
    & v_{3} = \frac{-9500}{2350} && \text{divide through by 2350} \newline
    & v_{3} = -4.04ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}

---

3. Would the wreckage keep moving at this velocity? Why or why not?

In the real world, no, because energy will be lost to the surroundings through heat and sound due to friction on the road, air resistance and engine friction.

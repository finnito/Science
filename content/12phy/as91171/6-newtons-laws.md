## Newton's First Law {.c2}

> Every object persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it.
>
> __TLDR__: A non-zero net force will induce a change in velocity (an acceleration).

### Examples {.c2}

- __Car Crash__: A person not wearing a seatbelt during a crash will continue their motion forwards as the car suddenly stops.
- __Ball__: A ball rolling on a soccer field will come to a stop because of the friction force acting upon it, creating a negative acceleration (deacceleration).

## Newton's Second Law {.c2}

> Force is equal to the change in momentum per change in time. For a constant mass, force equals mass times acceleration. $F=m \times a$
> 
> __TLDR__: The acceleration created by a force depends directly upon the mass of the object.

### Examples {.c2}

- A student pushing a trolley can cause a great deal of acceleration
- A student pushing a car will cause very little (or no acceleration)

## Newton's Third Law {.c2}

> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

### Examples {.c2}

- __Rockets__: Gas is ignited causing it to heat and expand. It is expelled out a narrow nozzel at a high velocity. An equal and opposite force is exerted on the spacecraft causing it to move forwards.
- __Bouncing Balls__: A ball thrown on the ground exerts a force on contact. The ground exerts an equal and opposite force which causes the ball to bounce.

## PƒÅtai

With the person next to you, write a paragraph describing how Newton's 1st and 2nd Laws relate to projectile motion.

### Whakatika

- Newton's 1st Law
    + __A non-zero net force will induce a change in velocity (an acceleration)__
    + In the x-direction there are no forces acting (friction is negligible).
    + In the y-direction there is only the weight force of the object. This means the resultant force is in the downwards direction.
    + An constant acceleration is therefore induced in the downwards direction at all times.

---

- Newton's 2nd Law
    + __The acceleration created by a force depends directly upon the mass of the object.__
    + In Earth's gravitational field at sea level, $g=9.81ms^{-2}$ at all times, and therefore the object is accelerated uniformly down.

## Mahi Tuatahi

1. Yssy travels 30km south and then 20km west. Draw a vector diagram to show her total __displacement (resultant)__.
2. Max and Lena are pushing a box. Max is pushing it with force 500N to the right, and Lena is pushing it with force 400N up. Draw a vector diagram to show the __net (resultant) force__.
3. Phoebe is flying at $7ms^{-1}$ east. Phoebe changes direction so she flying at $7ms^{-1}$ south. Draw a vector diagram to show her __change in velocity__.

## Projectile Motion

> Motion under gravity. Friction forces are ignored. Gravity is the only force acting. Motion up and motion down are symmetrical.

## Mahi Tuatahi

1. Calculate the height that your ball reached yesterday in your experiment
2. Complete the calculation at the bottom of yesterday's worksheet

### Pātai: Describing Velocity

We first need to correctly describe the _velocity_ and _acceleration_ of an object in motion.

A ball is thrown vertically upwards. __In pairs on a whiteboard, draw two diagrams and indicate the direction of the ball's velocity and acceleration when:__

1. It is going up,
2. it is going down,
3. it is at the highest point.

### Forces on Projectiles

- We assume that friction force is negligible (we ignore it).
- Therefore, _the only force_ acting upon the ball while in the air is the __weight force__.
- Weight force acts in the vertical direction only ($a_{y} = g = 9.8ms^{-2}, v \ne const.$)
- No forces act in the horizontal ($a_{x} = 0, v=const.$)

---

### Acceleration Due to Gravity

$$
\begin{aligned}
	a = g = 9.8ms^{-2} \text{ (down)}
\end{aligned}
$$

> The acceleration of any object in the air without any external forces acting on it.

### 1D Projectile Motion: In Summary

- An object that moves through the air __without its own power source__;
- the only force acting upon it is the __weight force__;
- it is always experiencing __downward acceleration of $9.8ms^{-2}$__;
- motion up/down is symmetrical.

## 2-D Projectile Motion: The Cannon Ball {.c2}

<div>
A cannon ball is fired horizontally from the top of a hill. The velocity of the cannon ball is split into $x$ and $y$ components, which are independent of each other.

1. Weight force is the only force acting.
2. The cannonball accelerates in the y direction ($a_{y} = g = 9.2ms^{-2}$).
3. No forces are acting in the horizontal direction, so velocity is constant ($a_{x} = 0$).
</div>

### Pātai: Hammer Throw {.c2}

<div>
Hume throws a hammer as far as he can during the Highland Games. It has an initial velocity of $12ms^{-1}$ on an angle of $40^{\circ}$ to the ground. __How far does it go?__

Steps:

1. Separate the x and y values that you know.
2. Calculate the x and y initial velocities (use a diagram).
3. Calculate how long does it take for the projectile to reach the top of its path?
4. What is the total time of flight?
5. How far can it travel horizontally in that time?
</div>

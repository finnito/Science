## Projectile Motion

> Parabolic motion due to gravity. Friction forces are ignored. Gravity is the only force acting. Motion up and motion down are symmetrical.

### Describing Velocity {.c2}

We need to be able to describe the _velocity_ and _acceleration_ of an object in projectile motion.

### Forces on Projectiles {.c2}

- We assume that friction force is negligible (we ignore it).
- <mark>Therefore, _the only force_ acting upon the ball while in the air is the __weight force__.</mark>
- Weight force acts in the vertical direction only ($a_{y} = g = 9.8ms^{-2}, v_{y} \ne const.$)
- <mark>No forces act in the horizontal ($a_{x} = 0, v_{x}=const.$)</mark>

- it is always experiencing __downward acceleration of $9.8ms^{-2}$__;
- motion up/down is symmetrical.
- The path is follows is in the shape of a parabola.

## Full Projectile Motion {.c2}

<div>
A cannon ball is fired horizontally from the top of a hill. The velocity of the cannon ball is split into $x$ and $y$ components, which are independent of each other.

1. Weight force is the only force acting.
2. The cannonball accelerates in the y direction ($a_{y} = g = 9.8ms^{-2}$).
3. No forces are acting in the horizontal direction, so velocity is constant ($a_{x} = 0$).
</div>

## Three Types of Projectile Motion

![](../assets/types-of-parabolas.png)

You need to be able to solve all three types for the exam! We have covered Half and full parabolas so far, now we will do __partial parabolas__!.

### Tauria / Example: Tossing a Ball

Ben kicks a ball to Elias who is standing $12m$ away. Elias is $180cm$ tall, and the ball has an initial velocity of $7ms^{-1}$ at an angle of $37^{\circ}$ to the horizontal. __Does the ball travel over Elias' head, hit them, or fall short?__

1. Calculate the x and y components of the initial velocity
2. __Think Horizontal__: Calculate the time taking for the ball to reach Elias
3. __Think Vertical__: What is the height (d) at time t (from above)?
4. Turn your numerical answer into a sentence explaining what you found.

#### Whakatika

1. Calculate the x and y components of the initial velocity

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{x} &= vcos(\theta) = 7cos(37) = 5.59ms^{-1} \cr
v_{y} &= vsin(\theta) = 7sin(37) = 4.21ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

2. __Think Horizontal__: Calculate the time taking for the ball to reach Elias

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{K:  } v_{xi} = 5.59ms^{-1}, a_{x} = 0ms^{-1}, d_{x} = 12m \cr
&\text{U:  } t = ? \cr
&\text{F:  } d = v_{i}t + \frac{1}{2}at^{2} \cr
&\text{S:  } 12 = 5.59 \times t + \frac{1}{1} \times 0 \times t^{2} \cr
&\text{S:  } \frac{12}{5.59} = t = 2.15s
\end{aligned}
$$

---

3. __Think Vertical__: What is the height (d) at time t (from above)?

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{K: } v_{yi} = 4.21ms^{-1}, a = 9.8ms^{-2}, t = 2.15s \cr
&\text{U: } d = ? \cr
&\text{F: } d = v_{i}t + \frac{1}{2}at^{2} \cr
&\text{S: } d = (4.21 \times 2.15) + (0.5 \times -9.8 \times 2.15^{2}) \cr
&\text{S: } d = -13.60m
\end{aligned}
$$

<mark>A height of $-13.60m$ indicates that it is lower than where it begin. This means that it fell short of Elias and hit the ground.</mark>

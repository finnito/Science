## Akoranga 10 Mahi Tuatahi

1. Yssy travels 30km south and then 20km west. Draw a vector diagram to show her total __displacement (resultant)__.
2. Max and Lena are pushing a box. Max is pushing it with force 500N to the right, and Lena is pushing it with force 400N up. Draw a vector diagram to show the __net (resultant) force__.
3. Phoebe is flying at $7ms^{-1}$ east. Phoebe changes direction so she flying at $7ms^{-1}$ south. Draw a vector diagram to show the __change in velocity__ of Phoebe.

### Pātai: Describing Velocity

To get into projectile motion we first need to correctly describe the _velocity_ and _acceleration_ of an object in motion.

A ball is thrown vertically upwards. __In pairs on a whiteboard, draw a diagram and describe the direction of the ball's velocity and acceleration when:__

1. It is going up,
2. it is going down,
3. it is at the highest point.

### Forces on The Ball
We assume that friction force is negligible (we ignore it).

Therefore, _the only force_ acting upon the ball while in the air is the __weight force__.

\begin{aligned}
    F_{net} = F_{weight}
\end{aligned}

The ball experiences a constant downwards acceleration ($-9.8ms^{-2}$) at all times, and __no__ acceleration in the horizontal direction.

---

### Acceleration Due to Gravity

\begin{aligned}
	g = 9.8ms^{-2}
\end{aligned}

> The acceleration of any object in the air without its own power source.

### So, Projectile Motion

- An object what moves through the air __without its own power source__,
- only force acting upon it is the __weight force__,
- always experiencing __downward acceleration of $9.8ms^{-2}$__.

---

### Pātai Tahi

A ball is thrown upwards with an initial speed of __161.3km/hr ($44.8ms^{-1}$)__.

1. How long does it take for the ball to reach its highest point?
2. How high does the ball rise?

__Remember:__ Knowns, Unknowns, Formula, Substitute, Solve

### Pātai Rua

Lachie kicks a rugby ball straight upwards. It is in the air for __10.6s__ before it hits the ground.

1. What is the inital velocity of the ball?
2. How high does the ball rise?

__Remember:__ Knowns, Unknowns, Formula, Substitute, Solve

# Question
Angus is going cliff diving. He jumps and falls for __3.4s__ before hitting the water below.

1. What is his __initial velocity__?
2. What is his __acceleration__?
3. What is his __final velocity__ (as he hits the water)?
4. How __high__ is the cliff?

__Remember:__ Knowns, Unknowns, Formula, Substitute, Solve

# A Classic: The Cannon Ball Question

A cannon ball is fired horizontally from the top of a hill.
The velocity of the cannon ball is split into two components:

1. __Vertical motion__, and
2. __horizontal motion__.

__Note__ - These motions are __independent of each other__. That is, they do not affect each other.

---

# Vertical Motion

__Recall:__ once in motion, the only force acting upon the cannon ball is the __weight force__. We are assuming friction is negligible.

Therefore:

The cannon ball is experiencing a constant downward acceleration of $g=-9.8ms^{-2}$.

---

# Horizontal Motion

__Recall:__ once in motion, the only force acting upon the cannon ball is the __weight force__. We are assuming friction is negligible.

Therefore, the cannon ball does not experience any forces in the horizontal direction. Therefore it does not accelerate in the horizontal direction.

---

# Summary

\begin{aligned}
	Projectile Motion = Vertial Motion + Horizontal Motion
\end{aligned}

## Vertical Motion
Constant downwards acceleration of $-9.8ms^{-2}$.

## Horizontal Motion
No acceleration, therefore constant speed. $v_{i} = v_{f}$

---

# Thought Whakamātau
If the cannon ball is fired with a __greated horizontal velocity__ will it take longer to hit the ground?

---

# Question
A marble rolls of a desk of height 1.25m and with $v_{x} = 1.6ms^{-1}$.

1. Calculate the __duration of the fall__.
2. During the fall, how far does the marble travel __horizontally__?
3. How far does the marble travel if $v_{x} = 3ms^{-1}$?

## Mahi Tuatahi

Try and solve this problem:

A car initially travelling at $13ms^{-1}$ rolls down a straight slope, accelerating at $0.6 ms^{-2}$ for $10 s$. How far does the car travel in this time?

## Kinematic Equations

Five variables - five equations!

\begin{aligned}
    & v_{f} = v_{i} + at \newline
    & d = \frac{v_{i} + v_{f}}{2}t \newline
    & v_{f}^{2} = v_{i}^{2} + 2ad \newline
    & d = v_{i}t + \frac{1}{2}at^{2} \newline
    & d = v_{f}t - \frac{1}{2}at^{2}
\end{aligned}

<p class="instruction">In your book, using a page in landscape, re-arrange each equation for each different variable!</p>

## Pātai Tahi:

A car initially travelling at $13ms^{-1}$ rolls down a straight slope, accelerating at $0.6 ms^{-2}$ for $10 s$. How far does the car travel in this time?

\begin{aligned}
    &  && \text{Knowns}  \newline
    &  && \text{Unknowns} \newline
    &  && \text{Formula} \newline
    &  && \text{Sub and Solve} 
\end{aligned}

__Step One – “knowns”__

A car initially travelling at $13ms^{-1}$ rolls down a straight slope, accelerating at $0.6 ms^{-2}$ for $10 s$. How far does the car travel in this time?

$v_{i} = 13ms^{-1}, a=0.6ms^{-2}, t=10s$

---

__Step Two – "unknowns"__

A car initially travelling at $13ms^{-1}$ rolls down a straight slope, accelerating at $0.6 ms^{-2}$ for $10 s$. How far does the car travel in this time?

$d = ?, v_{f} = \text{ not needed}$

---

__Step Three – "formula"__

Which formula does not include $v_{f}$?

---

__Step Four - "substitute"__

\begin{aligned}
    & d = v_{f}t + \frac{1}{2}at^{2} \newline
    & d = (13 \times 10) + (\frac{1}{2} \times 0.6 \times 10^{2}) \newline
\end{aligned}

---

__Step Five - "solve"__

\begin{aligned}
    & d = v_{f}t + \frac{1}{2}at^{2} \newline
    & d = (13 \times 10) + (\frac{1}{2} \times 0.6 \times 10^{2}) \newline
    & d = 130 + 30 = 160m
\end{aligned}

## Pātai Rua

A windsurfer initially travelling at $3 ms^{-1}$ is accelerated by a strong wind gust, at $0.08 ms^{-2}$. What would be the windsurfer’s speed when he has travelled $100 m$ since the wind gust started?

\begin{aligned}
    &  && \text{Knowns}  \newline
    &  && \text{Unknowns} \newline
    &  && \text{Formula} \newline
    &  && \text{Sub and Solve} 
\end{aligned}

## Pātai Toru

What time does it take for an airplane to decelerate uniformly from $120 ms^{-1}$ to a stop if the distance covered along the runway is $1500 m$?

\begin{aligned}
    &  && \text{Knowns}  \newline
    &  && \text{Unknowns} \newline
    &  && \text{Formula} \newline
    &  && \text{Sub and Solve} 
\end{aligned}

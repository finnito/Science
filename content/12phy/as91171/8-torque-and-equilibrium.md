For a car of __mass 1500kg__ which is accelerating at $3.7ms^{-2}$:

1. What net force is needed to maintain this acceleration?

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &  && \text{Knowns}  \cr
    &  && \text{Unknowns} \cr
    &  && \text{Formula} \cr
    &  && \text{Sub and Solve} 
\end{aligned}
$$

2. If the engine is producing $6000N$ of thrust, why is this different from your calculation?

## Torque ($\tau$) -- Tōpana Whakahuri

Torque can be thought of as the __turning effect__ around a __pivot__.
Torque is sometimes known as __moment__ or __leverage__.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \tau &= Fd_{\bot} \cr
    torque &= Newtons \times metres \cr
    torque &= \text{Newton meters (Nm)}
\end{aligned}
$$

- $F =$ force in Newtons 
- $d_{\bot} =$ perpendicular distance of force from pivot

---

## Torque ($\tau$) -- Tōpana Whakahuri {.c2}

- A small force at a small distance produces a small torque,
- the same small force at a larger distance produces a larger torque.
- <mark>The force is in a straight line</mark>
- <mark>The torque is circular (CW or CCW)</mark>

### Pātai: Individual Torques {.c2}

<div>

1. $9N$ acting up at a distance of $10cm$ is needed to lift the top off a bottle of soft drink. __Calculate the torque applied.__
2. Calculate the torque applied if the lever is stretched to $75cm$.
3. Calculate the torque applied if the lever is compressed to $1cm$.

</div>

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &  && \text{Knowns}  \cr
    &  && \text{Unknowns} \cr
    &  && \text{Formula} \cr
    &  && \text{Sub and Solve} 
\end{aligned}
$$

### Pātai Whā: Does torque have a direction?

Yes, and you must always state which direction it is acting in.

__Clockwise or Anticlockwise__

## Torque & Equilibrium

![](../assets/equilibrium-meme.gif)

---

## Equilibrium, Expanded

_Newton's First Law_ tells us equilibrium is when an object is __at rest__ or __moving uniformly__ ($F_{net}=0$).

For this to occur we need two things to be true. <mark>You must state these assumptions when doing any equilibrium question.</mark>

1. Sum of all forces to be 0 ($\sum F = 0N$)
2. Sum of all torques to be 0 ($\sum\tau = 0Nm$)

<!--### Pātai Toru {.c2}

![](../assets/torque-rock.png)

The rock has mass $1100kg$ and is at distance $50cm$ from the pivot. If Ash exerts $70N$ of downward force at a distance of $8m$ from the pivot can he move the rock?

---

### Pātai Whā

Archimedes once said: _"Give me a place to stand and I will move the world"_

__Question__: Assuming the mass of the Earth is $5.972\times 10^{24} kg$ at a distance of 1km from the pivot and Archimedes' mass is $75kg$, how long would his lever have to be?

## Torque & Equilibrium

The plank may not be massless. You may need to take it into account.

![](../assets/torque-due-to-plank.png)

- The mass of the plank acts through its __centre of gravity__
- Because the plank is uniform, this is the middle of the plank

---

## How To Solve A Torque Problem

1. Draw and label all forces on a diagram
2. Draw and label the distances between all forces and the __pivot__
3. Calculate all clockwise torque
4. Calculate all anticlockwise torque
5. Balance torques & forces
6. Find the unknown value

### Pātai: Balanced or Unbalanced? {.c2}

![](../assets/torque-uneven.png)

- $d_{1}=30cm$, $d_{2}=70cm$, $m_{1}=900g$, $m_{2}=300g$, \cr see-saw mass = $100g$.
- __Is the system in equilibrium?__
- Step 1: Calculate the total anticlockwise moment
- Step 2: Calculate the total clockwise moment
- Check if they are balanced.

---

### Pātai: Unknown Force {.c2}

![](../assets/torque-uneven.png)

- Assume the system is in equilibrium ($\tau_{clockwise} = \tau_{anticlockwise}$)
- $d_{1}=0.5m$, $d_{2}=1.5m$, $F_{1}=2.5N$, see-saw mass = $0.5kg$, $F_{2}=?$.
- Draw the weight force of the see-saw on your diagram
- Find the unknown force, $F_{2}$

#### Whakatika

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{CW} &= \tau_{ACW} \cr
\tau_{p} + \tau_{2} &= \tau_{1} \cr
F_{p}d_{p} + F_{2}d_{2} &= F_{1}d_{1} \cr
((0.5 \times 9.8)\times 0.5) + F_{2}\times 1.5 &= 2.5 \times 0.5 \cr
2.45 + F_{2} \times 1.5 &= 1.25 \cr
F_{2} &= \frac{1.25 - 2.45}{1.5} = -0.8N
\end{aligned}
$$

This is an interesting answer - it implies that $F_{2}$ is actually acting __up__.

### Pātai: Finding the Supports {.c2}

![](../assets/finding-supports-q.png)

- Given that the bridge weighs $10,000kg$, find the support force provided by A and B.
    + To find __A__, we make __B__ the pivot. We also ignore $F_{B}$ because it acting at the pivot and cannot provide any rotational forces.
    + To find __B__, we make __A__ the pivot. We also ignore $F_{A}$ because it acting at the pivot and cannot provide any rotational forces.
- Solve for each support independently.

---

#### Whakatika: Support A

![](../assets/finding-supports-a.png)

---

<mark>_We are assuming the bridge is in equilibrium. This means that both net torque and net force are zero._</mark>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{CW} &= \tau_{ACW} \cr
\tau_{P} + \tau_{C} &= \tau_{A} \cr
F_{P}d_{P} + F_{C}d_{C} &= F_{A}d_{A} \cr
(m_{p}g)d_{p} + (m_{c}g)d_{C} &= F_{A}d_{A} \cr
((10,000 \times 9.8) \times 25) + ((1,000 \times 9.8) \times 40) &= F_{A} \times 50 \cr
2,450,000 + 392,000 &= F_{A} \times 50 \cr
\frac{2,842,000}{50} &= F_{A} = 56,840N
\end{aligned}
$$

---

#### Whakatika: Support B

![](../assets/finding-supports-b.png)

---

<mark>_We are assuming the bridge is in equilibrium. This means that both net torque and net force are zero._</mark>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{CW} &= \tau_{ACW} \cr
\tau_{B} &= \tau_{P} + \tau_{C} \cr
F_{B}d_{B} &= F_{P}d_{P} + F_{C}d_{C} \cr
F_{B}d_{B} &= (m_{P}g)d_{P} + (m_{C}g)d_{C} \cr
F_{B} \times 50 &= (10,000 \times 9.8 \times 25) + (1,000 \times 9.8 \times 10) \cr
F_{B} \times 50 &= 2450000 + 98000 \cr
F_{B} &= \frac{2,548,000}{50} = 50,960N
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Ngā Whakaaro / Thoughts {.c2}

![](../assets/finding-supports-thinking.png)

Because the car is closer to support B, it makes logical sense that support B should feel more of the weight force. Therefore, it needs to provide more support force in order to stay in equilibrium.

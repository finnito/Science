## Mahi Tuatahi: Draw a diagram indicating all the forces acting upon you

---

## Drawing Force Diagrams {.c2}

- __Use these tips to draw a second, improved diagram__
- Use arrows (force is a vector)
- Label with names
- Label with numerical values
- Start arrows from center of mass
- Length indicates magnitude
- Use dashes to indicate equally sized vectors

### Pātai: Vector Reminder

On your whiteboards, add these vectors (head to tail) to find the resultant (net) force acting.

### Pātai: Acceleration

For each, calculate the acceleration that a $5kg$ object would experience.

---

### Equilibrium

> A state of zero acceleration (constant velocity) due to $F_{net} = 0$.

- When performing vector addition, equilibrium is seen by the vectors starting and ending at the same point.
- Vector diagrams having different start and end points indicates disequilibrium, and thus $F_{net} \neq 0N$.

---

### Recall: Newton's Second Law {.c2}

> Force is equal to the change in momentum per change in time. For a constant mass, force equals mass times acceleration. $F=m \times a$

__TLDR__: The acceleration created by a force depends directly upon the mass of the object.

## Pātai: Terminal Velocity {.c2}

![[Source]()](../assets/terminal-velocity.png)

1. What is my net force? <br><br><br>
2. What is my acceleration?<br><br><br>
3. Why does it not equal $g$?<br><br><br>
4. What is my drag and weight forces were balanced?<br><br><br>

### Whakatika {.c2}

![[Source]()](../assets/terminal-velocity.png)

1. What is my net force? <br>$620N$ down<br>
2. What is my acceleration?<br>$F=ma, a=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{620}{72}=8.61ms^{-2}$<br>
3. Why does it not equal $g$?<br>Because friction is acting against the weight force!<br>
4. What if my drag and weight forces were balanced?<br>$F_{net}=0$ and therefore $a=0$ and I would be in equilibrium.<br>

- __Friction__: Acts against the direction of motion between two in-contact moving objects.
- __Weight__: Acts down towards the center of mass of the object attracting you.
- __Applied__: Often called thrust/push/pull depending on the situation.
- __Drag__: Acts against the direction of motion when an object moves through a medium (e.g. air)

---

- __Spring__: A compressed or extended spring can exert a force in the opposite direction to its displacement.
- __Magnetic__: A moving charged object inside an electric field will experience a magnetic force.
- __Tension__: A force exerted through a non-rigid object like rope
- __Buoyant__: A force felt due to the displacement of another medium (air, water)
- __Normal/Support__: A force exerted by a rigid object at $90\degree$ to the surface (equal and opposite to the force being applied to it).

---

## Support/Normal Force {.c2}

- If the surface is sufficiently strong, the support/normal force will always oppose the force acting upon it exactly
- It will always act at $90\degree$ to the surface

<p class="instruction">Draw equal and opposite weight and normal forces on your diagram.</p>

### Whakatika

---

## Support/Normal Forces on an Angle {.c2}

- It will always act at $90\degree$ to the surface
- In this case, the normal force does not equal the weight force
- This is because not all of the weight force is acting __perpendicular__ to the surface.

![](../assets/support-force-angle-1.png)

---

## {.c2}

- It instead is __equal and opposite to the component of the weight force perpendicular to the surface__.
- We can find it using the right triangle that is formed between the weight force exerted on the plane, and the total net force.
- $F_{n} = F_{w}cos(\theta)$
- The angle inside this triangle is the same as the angle of the incline.

---

## Calculating a Missing Force

- __If__ an object is in equilibrium, we can calculate a missing force by assuming $F_{net} = 0$.
- Take the three forces acting upon the object and add them through __vector addition__
- They should form a closed right-angled triangle, allowing you to find the unknown side.

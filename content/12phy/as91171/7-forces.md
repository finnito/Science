## Drawing Force Diagrams {.c2}

- __Use these tips to draw a second, improved diagram__
- Use arrows (force is a vector)
- Label with names
- Label with numerical values
- Start arrows from center of mass
- Length indicates magnitude
- Use dashes to indicate equally sized vectors

### Pātai: Vector Reminder

1. Draw a vector diagram for each situation.
2. Illustrate and label the _resultant_ force.
3. Calculate the acceleration each experiences given $m=5kg$.

---

### Equilibrium

> A state of zero acceleration (constant velocity) due to $F_{net} = 0N$. E.g. vector diagram starts and ends at the same spot.

- Vector diagrams having different start and end points indicates disequilibrium, and thus $F_{net} \neq 0N$.

1. __What is my net force?__ <br><br><br>
2. __What is my acceleration?__<br><br><br>
3. __Why does it not equal $g$?__<br><br><br>
4. __What if my drag and weight forces were balanced?__<br><br><br>

### Whakatika {.c2}

![[Source]()](../assets/terminal-velocity.png)

1. __What is my net force?__ <br>$620N$ down<br>
2. __What is my acceleration?__<br>$F=ma, a=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{620}{72}=8.61ms^{-2}$<br>
3. __Why does it not equal $g$?__<br>Because friction is acting against the weight force!<br>
4. __What if my drag and weight forces were balanced?__<br>$F_{net}=0$ and therefore $a=0$ and I would be in equilibrium.<br>

---

- __Friction__: Acts against the direction of motion between two in-contact moving objects.
- __Weight__: Acts down towards the center of mass of the object attracting you.
- __Applied__: Often called thrust/push/pull depending on the situation.
- __Drag__: Acts against the direction of motion when an object moves through a medium (e.g. air)

---

- __Spring__: A compressed or extended spring can exert a force in the opposite direction to its displacement.
- __Magnetic__: A moving charged object inside an electric field will experience a magnetic force.
- __Tension__: A force exerted through a non-rigid object like rope
- __Buoyant__: A force felt due to the displacement of another medium (air, water)
- __Normal/Support__: A force exerted by a rigid object at $90\degree$ to the surface (equal and opposite to the force being applied to it).

---

## Support/Normal Force {.c2}

- If the surface is sufficiently strong, the support/normal force will always oppose the force acting upon it exactly
- It will always act at $90\degree$ to the surface
- <mark>❗️ Draw equal and opposite weight and normal forces on your diagram.</mark>
- <mark>❗️ What would occur if the support force was less than the weight force?</mark>

### Whakatika

---

## Support/Normal Forces on an Angle {.c2}

- It will always act at $90\degree$ to the surface
- In this case, the normal force does not equal the weight force
- This is because not all of the weight force is acting __perpendicular__ to the surface.

![](../assets/support-force-angle-1.png)

---

## {.c2}

- __ Support is equal and opposite to the component of the weight force perpendicular to the surface__.
- We can find it using the right triangle that is formed between the weight force exerted on the plane, and the total net force.
- $F_{n} = F_{w}cos(\theta)$
- The angle inside this triangle is the same as the angle of the incline.

## Calculating a Missing Force

- <mark>__If__ an object is in equilibrium, we can calculate a missing force by knowing $F_{net} = 0$ and drawing a vector diagram</mark>
- They _should_ form a closed right-angled triangle, allowing you to find the unknown side with Pythag/trig.

## Case Study

<p class="instruction">Step 1. Consider what we know about the motion of the object, and what this implies about the net force acting upon the object.</p>

- What force do we know is __not__ acting due to the cars movement?<br><br>
- Therefore, what three forces __are__ acting?<br><br>

#### Question 1 Whakatika {.c2}

![](../assets/hw-q30-a-answers.png)

- What force do we know is __not__ acting due to the cars movement?<br>_Thrust, because it is not accelerating._<br><br>

- What do we know about the motion of the car?<br><br>
- Therefore, what can we say about its acceleration, forces and state of equilibrium?<br><br>

#### Question 2 Whakatika {.c2}

![](../assets/hw-q30-b-answers.png)

#### Question 3 Whakatika {.c2}

![](../assets/hw-q30-c-answers-1.png)

- We need to calculate the __weight force__ of the car. Hint: $F=ma$.<br>_$W=F=m \times a = 1500 \times 9.8 = 14700N$. Use $a = g$ because weight force is due to gravity._<br>
- Recognise & state that not all of the weight force acts directly through the slope.<br>_Because the weight force is acting on an angle to the slop, the component perpendicular to the slope is equal & opposite to the normal force._<br>

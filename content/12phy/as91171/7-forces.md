## Mahi Tuatahi: Draw a diagram indicating all the forces acting upon you

---

## Drawing Force Diagrams {.c2}

- __Use these tips to draw a second, improved diagram__
- Use arrows (force is a vector)
- Label with names
- Label with numerical values
- Start arrows from center of mass
- Length indicates magnitude
- Use dashes to indicate equally sized vectors

### Pātai: Vector Reminder

On your whiteboards, add these vectors (head to tail) to find the resultant (net) force acting.

### Pātai: Acceleration

For each, calculate the acceleration that a $5kg$ object would experience.

### Equilibrium

> A state of zero acceleration (constant velocity) due to $F_{net} = 0$.

- When performing vector addition, equilibrium is seen by the vectors starting and ending at the same point.
- Vector diagrams having different start and end points indicates disequilibrium, and thus $F_{net} \neq 0N$.

### Recall: Newton's Second Law {.c2}

> Force is equal to the change in momentum per change in time. For a constant mass, force equals mass times acceleration. $F=m \times a$

__TLDR__: The acceleration created by a force depends directly upon the mass of the object.

## Pātai: Terminal Velocity {.c2}

![[Source]()](../assets/terminal-velocity.png)

1. What is my net force? <br><br><br>
2. What is my acceleration?<br><br><br>
3. Why does it not equal $g$?<br><br><br>
4. What is my drag and weight forces were balanced?<br><br><br>

### Whakatika {.c2}

![[Source]()](../assets/terminal-velocity.png)

1. What is my net force? <br>$620N$ down<br>
2. What is my acceleration?<br>$F=ma, a=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{620}{72}=8.61ms^{-2}$<br>
3. Why does it not equal $g$?<br>Because friction is acting against the weight force!<br>
4. What if my drag and weight forces were balanced?<br>$F_{net}=0$ and therefore $a=0$ and I would be in equilibrium.<br>

## Average Speed

\begin{aligned}
    & v = \frac{d}{t} \\
    & d = \text{total distance travelled} \\
    & t = \text{time} \\
    & v = \text{speed}
\end{aligned}

<p class="instruction">Write this equation in your book and give the unit for each letter in the equation.</p>

---

### What is the Unit?

- $ms^{-1}$
- It stands for __meters per second__
- E.g. the speed of sound is $343ms^{-1}$
- _Sound travels $330m$ in one second_

---

### Example / _Tauria_

Ash runs $315m$ in $45s$. Calculate his average speed in __meters per second__.

1. __Knowns:__ 
2. __Unknowns:__ 
3. __Formula:__ 
4. __Substitute:__ 
5. __Solve:__

#### Whakatika

Ash runs $315m$ in $45s$. Calculate his average speed in __meters per second__.

\begin{aligned}
    & d = 315m, t = 45s \\
    & v = ? \\
    & v = \frac{d}{t} \\
    & v = \frac{315}{45} \\
    & v = 7ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}

### The Speed Of

- A skydiver (freefall) = $53ms^{-1}$
- A handgun bullet = $660ms^{-1}$
- A car on the road = $50km/hr$
- A flying airplane = $1100kmh^{-1}$
- Light = $300,000,000$

<p class="instruction">Pātai: In pairs, convert the speed of an airplane to meters per second.</p>

---

#### Whakatika

\begin{aligned}
    v &= \frac{1100km}{hr} \\
    &= \frac{1100km \times 1000}{60 \times 60} \\
    &= \frac{1100000}{3600} = 305.56ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}

### Pātai

A car is moving at a speed of $10ms^{-1}$. How far does the car travel in $12s$?

1. __Knowns:__ 
2. __Unknowns:__ 
3. __Formula:__ 
4. __Substitute:__ 
5. __Solve:__ 

---

#### Whakatika

A car is moving at a speed of $10ms^{-1}$. How far does the car travel in $12s$?

\begin{aligned}
    v &= 10ms^{-1}, t=12s \\
    d &= ? \\
    v &= \frac{d}{t} \\
    10 &= \frac{d}{12} \\
    10 \times 12 &= d = 120m
\end{aligned}

### Pātai

A man is running at a speed of $4ms^{-1}$. How long does he take to run $100m$?

1. __Knowns:__ 
2. __Unknowns:__ 
3. __Formula:__ 
4. __Substitute:__ 
5. __Solve:__

#### Whakatika

A man is running at a speed of $4ms^{-1}$. How long does he take to run $100m$?

\begin{aligned}
    v &= 4ms^{-1}, d=100m \\
    t &= ? \\
    v &= \frac{d}{t} \\
    4 &= \frac{100}{t} \\
    4 \times t &= 100 \\
    t &= \frac{100}{4} = 25s
\end{aligned}

### Average vs Instantaneous Velocity

Velocity may refer to __average velocity__ or __instantaneous velocity__.

The formula $v = \frac{d}{t}$ can only be used to calculate __average velocity__ or when __the velocity is constant__.

---

## Acceleration

> The rate of change in speed

\begin{aligned}
    & a = \frac{\Delta v}{t} \\
    & \Delta v = \text{ change in speed} \\
    & t = \text{ time} \\
    & a = \text{ acceleration}
\end{aligned}

<aside class="notes">
    Ask class for units for each variable in the equation.
    Make note that these are Standard International units and should be used at all times.
</aside>

---

### What does $ms^{-2}$ mean?

_meters per second squared OR meters per second per second_

For example, $a=12ms^{-2}$ means that the velocity is increased by $12ms^{-1}$ every second.

---

### $\Delta$ = Delta

This is the difference between the __initial__ and the __final__ value.

\begin{aligned}
    & \Delta = final - initial \\
    & \text{e.g. }\Delta v = v_{f} - v_{i}
\end{aligned}

---

### Pātai

A man initially walking at $2.0ms^{-1}$ notices that his house is on fire so he speeds up to $11ms^{-1}$ in $1.3s$.

1. Calculate the change in speed
2. Calculate the acceleration

---

### Whakatika

\begin{aligned}
    & \Delta v = v_{f} - v_{i} \\
    & \Delta v = 11 - 2 = 9ms^{-1} \\
    & \\
    & a = \frac{\Delta v }{t} \\
    & a = \frac{9}{1.3} = 6.9ms^{-2}
\end{aligned}

---

### Pātai

A cyclist who has been travelling at a steady speed of $4ms^{-1}$ starts to accelerate. If he accelerates at $2.5ms^{-2}$, how long will he take to reach a speed of $24ms^{-1}$?

---

#### Whakatika

\begin{aligned}
    & a = \frac{\Delta v}{t} \\
    & t = \frac{\Delta v}{a} \\
    & t = \frac{24 - 4}{2.5} \\
    & t = 8s
\end{aligned}

---

### More Pātai

1. A car initially moving at $12.7ms^{-1}$ accelerates at $1.3ms^{-2}$ for __one minute__. What is the car's final speed?
2. A car decelerates at $1.8ms^{-2}$ for $9.4s$ to stop. What was the car's initial speed?

__Whakatika 1__

\begin{aligned}
    & a = \frac{v_{f} - v_{i}}{t} \\
    & a \times t = v_{f} - v_{i} \\
    & v_{f} = (a \times t) + v_{i} \\
    & v_{f} = (1.3 \times 60) + 12.7 = 90.7ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}

---

__Whakatika 2__

\begin{aligned}
    & a = \frac{v_{f} - v_{i}}{t} \\
    & a \times t = v_{f} - v_{i} \\
    & v_{i} = v_{f} - (a \times t) \\
    & v_{i} = 0 - (-1.8 \times 9.4) = -16.92ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}

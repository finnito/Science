## Average Speed

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & v = \frac{d}{t} \\
    & d = \text{total distance travelled} \\
    & t = \text{time} \\
    & v = \text{speed}
\end{aligned}
$$

<p class="instruction">Write this equation in your book and give the unit for each letter in the equation.</p>

### What is the Unit?

- $ms^{-1}$
- It stands for __meters per second__
- E.g. the speed of sound is $343ms^{-1}$
- _Sound travels $330m$ in one second_

### The Speed Of

- A skydiver (freefall) = $53ms^{-1}$
- A handgun bullet = $660ms^{-1}$
- A car on the road = $50km/hr$
- A flying airplane = $1100kmh^{-1}$
- Light = $300,000,000$

<p class="instruction">Pātai: In pairs, convert the speed of an airplane to meters per second.</p>

#### Whakatika

$$
\begin{aligned}
    v &= \frac{1100km}{hr} \newline
    &= \frac{1100km \times 1000}{60 \times 60} \newline
    &= \frac{1100000}{3600} = 305.56ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}

#### Whakatika

A man is running at a speed of $4ms^{-1}$. How long does he take to run $100m$?

$$
\begin{aligned}
    v &= 4ms^{-1}, d=100m \newline
    t &= ? \newline
    v &= \frac{d}{t} \newline
    4 &= \frac{100}{t} \newline
    4 \times t &= 100 \newline
    t &= \frac{100}{4} = 25s
\end{aligned}
$$

### Average vs Instantaneous Velocity

Velocity may refer to __average velocity__ or __instantaneous velocity__.

The formula $v = \frac{d}{t}$ can only be used to calculate __average velocity__ or when __the velocity is constant__.

## Acceleration

> The rate of change in speed

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & a = \frac{\Delta v}{t} \newline
    & \Delta v = \text{ change in speed} \newline
    & t = \text{ time} \newline
    & a = \text{ acceleration}
\end{aligned}
$$

<aside class="notes">
    Ask class for units for each variable in the equation.
    Make note that these are Standard International units and should be used at all times.
</aside>

### What does $ms^{-2}$ mean?

_meters per second squared OR meters per second per second_

For example, $a=12ms^{-2}$ means that the velocity is increased by $12ms^{-1}$ every second.

---

### $\Delta$ = Delta

This is the difference between the __initial__ and the __final__ value.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \Delta = final - initial \newline
    & \text{e.g. }\Delta v = v_{f} - v_{i}
\end{aligned}
$$

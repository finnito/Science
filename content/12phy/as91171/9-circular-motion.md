## Mahi Tuatahi

Aaron is painting the outside of his house. He is standing on a $3.5m$ long plank with a support at each end. The plank weighs $4.8kg$. He is standing $0.8m$ from the left side and he weighs $63kg$.

1. Draw a diagram to illustrate the situation
2. Calculate the support force provided by Support A (left) and Support B (right).

## Circular Motion

> The motion of an object moving in a circular path.

e.g. Satellites in orbit, car driving around a corner, discus thrower, cricket bowler.

## Circles {.c2}

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & Radius = r \cr
    & Diameter = d \cr
    & Circumference = C
\end{aligned}
$$

### Pātai Tahi (Q1): Circumference {.c2}

- How do we calculate circumference?
- __Whakatika__: $C = 2\pi r$
- Where $r$ is the radius of the circle

### Pātai Rua (Q2): What is Frequency? {.c2}

![](../assets/circle-gif.gif)

- Frequency is __the number of rotations in one second__.
- It is given the symbol $f$ and measured in $s^{-1}$ (per second).

---

### Pātai Toru (Q3): What is Period? {.c2}

![](../assets/circle-gif.gif)

- Period is __the time taken to do one revolution__.
- It is given the symbol $T$ and is measured in $s$ (seconds).
- Period and frequency are inversely related via this equation
- $T = \frac{1}{f}$

---

### Pātai {.c2}

![](../assets/circle-gif.gif)

1. Measure the period ($T$)
2. Calculate the frequency ($f$)

---

## Velocity on a Circle {.c2}

![](../assets/circle-gif.gif)

- Velocity is always given by $v = \frac{d}{t}$
- On a circle, $d = C = 2 \pi r$
- On a circle, $t = T = \frac{1}{f}$
- Therefore, circular velocity is $v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$

---

### Pātai Whā (Q4): Finding Velocity {.c2}

![](../assets/circle-gif.gif)

1. __If the radius is 2m, find the__: circumference,
2. and speed

---

#### Whakatika {.c2}

![](../assets/circle-gif.gif)

1. __If the radius is 2m, find the__: circumference,
    - $C = 2 \pi r = 2 \pi 2 = 12.57m$
2. period,
    - $T = 12s$
3. frequency
    - $f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{12} = 0.083^{-s}$
4. and speed
    - $v = \frac{d}{t} = \frac{12.57}{12} = 1.0475ms^{-1}$

---

### Pātai Rimu (Q5) {.c2}

![](../assets/circle-gif.gif)

- Is speed constant?
- Is velocity constant?

---

#### Whakatika {.c2}

![](../assets/circle-gif.gif)

- __Is speed constant?__
    + Speed is constant, because the __magnitude__ of the velocity is constant.
- __Is velocity constant?__
    + Velocity is not constant, because even though the magnitude is constant, the direction is changing.

## Centripetal Acceleration

> An object undergoing circular motion is always accelerating towards the center of the circle. Therefore, because the direction is changing, the velocity is changing. Therefore the object is always accelerating, even if its speed is constant.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    a_{c} &= \frac{v^{2}}{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Mahi Tuatahi

1. An ice skater performs a 720 degree jump. The outside of their shoulders rotate with a frequency of $1.5s^{-1}$. __Calculate the period of their rotations__.
2. If their shoulders are $30cm$ from their center of rotation, calculate their linear velocity.
3. Draw a diagram illustrating the things you know about their circle of rotation.

### Whakatika {.c2}

1. __An ice skater performs a 720 degree jump. The outside of their shoulders rotate with a frequency of $1.5s^{-1}$. Calculate the period of their rotations.__<br>$T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{1.5} = 0.667s$
2. __If their shoulders are $30cm$ from their center of rotation, calculate their linear velocity.__<br>$v=\frac{2 \pi r}{T} = \frac{2 \pi 0.3}{0.667} = 2.826ms^{-1}$
3. __Draw a diagram illustrating the things you know about their circle of rotation.__

### What Causes the Acceleration? {.c2}

- Newton 2nd Law tells us via $F=ma$ that __an acceleration is caused by an unbalanced force.__
- Therefore, centripetal (_center-seeking_) acceleration is caused by an unbalanced force which continuously pulls the object towards the center. __Centripetal force__.
- Net force and acceleration are always in the same direction.

## Centripetal Force

![](../assets/centripetal-force.png)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & F_{c} = \frac{mv^{2}}{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Centripetal force $\rightarrow$ centripetal acceleration $\rightarrow$ change direction of velocity $\rightarrow$ move in a circular path.
- Therefore, if the centripetal force is removed, the object will move in a straight line tangent to the circle.

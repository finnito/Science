## Pātai: Scalars vs Vectors

In pairs, think about and discuss the similarities and differences between these two questions:

- Mr Chu puts 40 apples inside a box, except Miss Nam eats two of them. What is the total number of apples inside the box?
- Ms Carpenter lifts a plant off her desk with a force of $15N$ in the upwards direction, while the plant has a weight force of $5N$ acting down. What is the total force applied on the plant?

## What is a Vector?

- __Scalar__ = size only (e.g. mass)
- __Vector__ = size __and__ direction (e.g. velocity)

<p class="instruction">Discuss with your partner the difference between velocity and speed.</p>

---

## Example: Distance vs Displacement

- __Distance__ is the amount an object has moved
    + It is a scalar
    + E.g. 3km
- __Displacement__ is the distance from start to finish in a straight line
    + It is a vector, because direction is also important
    + E.g. 3km south west

### Pātai

Ella drives to Sumner beach in the weekend because it is nice and hot outside. She drives $5km$ south and $10km$ west to get there.

- What is the total distance travelled by Ella?
- What is the total displacement of Ella?

---

#### Whakatika {.c2}

- Distance: $d = 5km + 10km = 15km$
- Displacement: ?

### Scalar or Vector? {.c2}

<div>

- Distance
- Displacement
- Speed
- Velocity
- Acceleration
- Momentum

</div>
<div>

- Energy
- Force
- Temperature
- Mass
- Work
- Power

</div>
---

When dealing with problems which involve vector quantities (e.g. calculating velocity, force, etc.), you must consider the size and direction.

Which means: __YOU MUST USE VECTOR DIAGRAMS__ (trigonometry) when working in two dimensions!

---

## Vectors {.c2}

<div>

- Have both __direction__ and __magnitude__
- Drawn as an arrow
- Drawn with a ruler
- Drawn to scale (on a grid, typically)

</div>
<div>

- Drawn head-to-tail
- Can be added an subtracted
- Use Pythagoras and SOH CAH TOA to find values

</div>

---

### Vector Addition

- To add vectors, we simply draw a the next vector from the _arrowhead_ of the previous one.
- Draw the resultant vector from start to finish in a separate colour.
- __Important__: The resultant vector should be pointing from start position to finish position

#### Why can't we add vectors algebraically? {.c2}

<div>
You help lift a box with a friend. You both apply 5N of force to lift it. What is the resultant force?
![](../assets/1D-forces.png)
</div>
<div>
With a second box your friend pushes sideways with 5N of force while you apply 5N up. What is the resultant force? Which direction is it going? What is it's size?
![](../assets/2D-forces.png)
</div>

## Vector Addition Example

A car is driven 3 km east for 200 seconds, then 4 km south for 250 seconds, then 3 km west for 150 seconds.

1. What is the total distance the car has travelled?
2. What is the total displacement of the car?
3. What is the average speed of the car?
4. What is the average velocity of the car?

$$
\begin{aligned}
    speed = \frac{distance}{time} \cr
    velocity = \frac{displacement}{time}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Vector Subtraction

Consider acceleration:

- Positive acceleration will increase speed
- Negative acceleration will decrease speed
- Pātai: What is different?
- Whakatika: The direction of the acceleration!

__Summary__: Vector subtraction is simply vector addition, where the subtracted vectors have their directions inverted.

---

## Vectors with $\Delta$

Velocity is a vector and a change ($\Delta$) is calculated like this: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Delta v &= v_{f} - v_{i} \cr
\end{aligned}
$$

__Pātai__: Looks like vector subraction to me. Can we turn it into addition?

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \Delta v = v_{f} - v_{i} \cr
    & \Delta v = v_{f} + (-v_{i}) \cr
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Example / _Tauria_

A soccer ball collides with the crossbar of a goalpost at $5ms^{-1}$. It rebounds at $4ms^{-1}$ in the opposite direction away from the crossbar. 

1. Draw a vector diagram illustrating this
2. Determine the ball's change in velocity using the $\Delta v$ equation
    - Remember to use __K,U,F,S,S__

### Answer / Whakatika {.c2}

![](../assets/delta-v-mahi-tuatahi.png)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Delta v^{2} &= v_{f}^{2} + v_{i}^{2}       \cr
    \Delta v &= \sqrt{v_{f}^{2} + v_{i}^{2}}    \cr
    \Delta v &= \sqrt{15^{2} + 5^{2}}           \cr
    \Delta v &= \sqrt{250} = 15.81ms^{-1}       \cr\cr
    tan(\theta) &= \frac{opp}{adj}              \cr
    \theta &= tan^{-1}(\frac{15}{5}) = 75.6\degree
\end{aligned}

## Vector Components {.c2}

- Similarly to how we create a _resultant vector_ by adding two vectors, we can decompose a vector on an angle into its horizontal and vertical components.
- __Pātai__: Draw two vectors which add together to _result_ in $\vec{C}$  (right-angled triangle).

---

- This is an important skill because the __x__ and __y__ components of a vector are __independent__.
- This means they do not influence each other (e.g. in projectile motion)

## Average Speed

\begin{align*}
    & v = \frac{d}{t} \\
    & d = \text{total distance travelled} \\
    & t = \text{time} \\
    & v = \text{speed}
\end{align*}

<aside class="notes">
    Ask class for units for each variable in the equation.
    Make note that these are Standard International units and should be used at all times.

### What does $ms^{-1}$ mean?

- It stands for __meters per second__
- E.g. the speed of sound is $330ms^{-1}$
- _Sound travels 300m in one second_

### Example

Ash runs 315m in 45s. Calculate his average speed in __meters per second__.

Ash runs 315m in 45s. Calculate his average speed in __meters per second__.

\begin{align*}
    & d = 315m, t = 45s \\
    & v = \frac{d}{t} \\
    & v = \frac{315}{45} \\
    & v = 7ms^{-1}
\end{align*}

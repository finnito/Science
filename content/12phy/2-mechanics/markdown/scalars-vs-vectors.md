## Starter

Mr LeSueur is cycling at a speed of $4ms^{-1}$ and starts to accelerate. If he accelerates at $3ms^{-2}$, how long will it take for him to reach a speed of $12ms^{-1}$?

## Scalar Quantities vs Vector Quantities

Think about and discuss the similarities and differences between these two situations:

- Mr Chu puts 40 apples inside a box, except Miss Nam eats two of them. What is the total number of apples inside the box?
- Mrs Carpenter lifts a plant off her desk with a force of $15N$ in the upwards direction, while the plant has a weight force of $5N$ acting down. What is the total force applied on the plant?

- __Scalar__ = size only
- __Vector__ = size + direction

## Distance vs Displacement

Ella drives to Sumner beach in the weekend because it is far too hot. She drives $5km$ south and $10km$ west to get there.

- What is the total distance travelled by Ella?
- What is the total displacement of Ella?

---

- __Distance__ is scalar because it only involves the __size__ and not the direction.
- __Displacement__ is a __vector__ quantity because it involves both __size and direction__.

---

### Scalar or Vector?

- Distance
- Displacement
- Speed
- Velocity
- Acceleration

---

- Energy
- Force
- Temperature
- Mass
- Work

---

- Power
- Momentum

---

When dealing with problems which involve vector quantities (e.g. calculating velocity, force, etc.), you must consider the size and direction.

Which means: __YOU MUST USE VECTOR CALCULATIONS  and/or VECTOR DIAGRAMS.__

A car is driven 3 km east for 200 seconds,  then 4 km south for 250 seconds, then 3 km west for 150 seconds.

1. What is the total distance the car has travelled?
2. What is the total displacement of the car?
3. What is the average speed of the car?
4. What is the average velocity of the car?

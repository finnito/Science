Tēnā koe,

My name is Finn Le Sueur and I will be <First Name>'s teacher for Year 12 Physics this year. <First Name> was given a letter to take home on Tuesday, but I thought I would attach it here in case it got lost en route.

The letter should answer many or most of your questions, but please do not hesitate to get in contact should you have any concerns.

Thank you for your support of <First Name>!

Mā te wā,
Finn Le Sueur

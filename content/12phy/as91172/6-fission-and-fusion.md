## Akoranga 9 Ngā Whāinga Ako

- Understand the difference between nuclear fission and fusion
- Use $E=mc^{2}$
- Use $P=\frac{E}{t}$

---

## Recall

There are three types of nuclear reactions

1. Radioactive decay ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$)
2. Nuclear fission
3. Nuclear fusion

---

## Fission

---

### Question

If the protons are positively charged, why don't they repel each other and the nucleus break apart?

---

### Electrostatic Force vs. Nuclear Force

- When nucleons are extremely close together, a very strong force called the Nuclear Force comes into effect.
- It is the nuclear force that holds the nucleons together and is stronger than the electrostatic force/repulsion between the protons.

---

### Radioactive Isotopes

- Some isotopes, such as polonium-211, have unnaturally large numbers of nucleons in their nuclei.
- In these isotopes, the nuclear force holding the nucleons together is not enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them (because there are too many) – making them _unstable_ or _radioactive_

---

### Absorption of a Nucleon

- If a fast moving nucleon can get extremely close to a nucleus of an atom, then the nuclear force will come into effect and it will be incorporated into the nucleus.
- This is easier to do with a neutron because neutrons have no charge so they do not experience any electrostatic repulsion (i.e. will not be repelled by protons).

### Pātai: Write 2x nuclear equations to express this reaction

#### Whakatika

\begin{align*}
    & {}^{1}_{0}n + {}^{235}_{92}U \rightarrow {}^{236}_{92}U \newline
    & {}^{236}_{92}U \rightarrow {}^{92}_{36}Kr + {}^{141}_{56}Ba + 3{}^{1}_{0}n
\end{align*}

__Extra pātai__: What do you think the three neutrons produced do?

## Nuclear Fusion {.c2}

- Unlike fission, in fusion we combine two whole nuclei together, instead of just adding a neutron
- __Pātai__: Write a nuclear equation to express this reaction!

#### Whakatika

\begin{align*}
    & {}^{3}_{1}H + {}^{2}_{1}H \rightarrow {}^{4}_{2}He + {}^{1}_{0}n
\end{align*}

---

### Producing Energy: Mass Balance

\begin{align*}
    & {}^{3}_{1}H + {}^{2}_{1}H \rightarrow {}^{4}_{2}He + {}^{1}_{0}n
\end{align*}

- Tritium (${}^{3}_{1}H$) $= 5.00641 \times 10^{-27} kg$
- Deuterium (${}^{2}_{1}H$) $= 3.3436 \times 10^{-27} kg$
- Helium (${}^{4}_{2}He$) $= 6.64466 \times 10^{-27} kg$
- Neutron (${}^{1}_{0}n$) $= 1.67493 \times 10^{-27} kg$

1. Calculate the total mass of the reactants.
2. Calculate the total mass of the products.

---

## Theory of Relativity, $E = mc^{2}$

- Mass is a form of energy
- Mass can turn into energy and energy can turn into mass (in nuclear reactions).

---

During the fusion process, the total mass is not conserved because some of the mass of the fusing nuclei is converted to energy.

\begin{align*}
    & E = mc^{2}
\end{align*}

- $E =$ energy
- $m =$ mass
- $c =$ speed of light ($3\times10^{8}ms^{-1}$)

### Pātai: Smoke Detector {.c2}

- Americium-241 undergoes $\alpha$ decay.
- __1.__ Write down the nuclear equation for the alpha decay of a nucleus of Americium-241.
- __2.__ Calculate the quantity of energy released when a nucleus of Americium-241 decays.

### Pātai: Nuclear Fission {.c2}

- In a fission reaction, an U-235 nucleus combines with a neutron, then splits into a Ba-141 nucleus, a Kr-92 nucleus and three neutrons. It also emits gamma radiation.
- Calculate the amount of energy released

### Pātai: Nuclear Reactor {.c2}

- A nuclear power plant in the US can produce one __gigawatt__ of power using U-235.
- Calculate the mass of U-235 required each year to run the plant.

## Tips for the Assessment

1. EXPLAIN your answers.
2. Watch out for the numbers NOT in standard forms (e.g. $\times 10^{-27}$)
3. Half-life – Draw a graph!!!
    - Don't forget about the shape of the exponential curve
4. Nuclear Equations – double check the atomic numbers and the mass numbers
5. $E = mc^{2}$ – SHOW CLEAR WORKING

1. Describe the key components of the history of the atom, including Dalton, Thompson and Rutherford models.
2. Describe Rutherford’s gold leaf experiment.
3. Define the terms proton, neutron, electron, nucleon, atomic mass, atomic number and isotope.
4. Understand the conditions governing atomic stability and therefore why some atoms are radioactive
5. Describe half-life, and the dangers of radioactive waste.
6. Complete basic calculations involving half-life.
7. Describe the three forms of radioactivity – Alpha, Beta and Gamma radiation.
8. Balance nuclear equations using the knowledge of the conservation of atomic and mass numbers.
9. Describe the effect a magnetic field has on each form of radiation
10. Describe binding energy and mass energy equivalence in terms of $E=mc^{2}$
11. Explain the difference between Fission and Fusion
12. Discuss how nuclear power is generated, safety features and dangers. Include basic history of Fukushima, Chernobyl, Windscale, Three Mile island, Hiroshima & and Nagasaki and K-19, K-27, K-413.

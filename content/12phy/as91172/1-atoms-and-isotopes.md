- Aristotle and the Greeks in 450BC thought that everything was made of water, earth, air and fire

---

In the modern day, we now know that everything is made up of about 119 elements.

---

## Question: What makes the elements different from each other?

- The number of protons contained inside them

---

We know that each element is made up of a unique type atom

# Atoms

- Atoms are made of three subatomic particles.
- __Write their names, charges and a diagram of their location in your books__

---

## Rutherford's Atomic Structure

- The central region is called the nucleus. It is made up of protons and neutrons which are strongly bound together by nuclear force.
- Protons and neutrons are called nucleons.

---

- Electrons are constantly moving around the nucleus in a probabilistic way.
- Protons have positive charge, electrons have negative charge and neutrons are neutral.
- The nucleus is very small compare to the size of the whole atom, but has 99.95% of the mass (because electrons are very light).

## Pātai Tahi

Give the number of protons, neutrons, electrons and nucleons for __oxygen__, __sodium__, __aluminium__ and __copper__.

|           | Nucleons | Protons | Neutrons | Electrons |
|:----------|:---------|:--------|:---------|:----------|
| Oxygen    |          |         |          |           |
| Sodium    |          |         |          |           |
| Aluminium |          |         |          |           |
| Copper    |          |         |          |           |

### Whakatika Tahi

|           | Nucleons | Protons | Neutrons | Electrons |
|:----------|:---------|:--------|:---------|:----------|
| Oxygen    | 16       | 8       | 8        | 8         |
| Sodium    | 23       | 11      | 12       | 11        |
| Aluminium | 27       | 13      | 14       | 13        |
| Copper    | 64       | 29      | 35       | 29        |

## Atomic and Mass Numbers

- Atomic number = the number of protons
- Mass number = the number of nucleons (protons AND neutrons)
- The number of protons in an atom (i.e. the atomic number) defines which type of atom it is. (e.g. an atom that has 6 protons MUST be a carbon atom, and cannot be any other)

---

Now add the atomic and mass numbers to __oxygen__, __sodium__, __aluminium__ and __copper__.

|           | Nucleons | Protons | Neutrons | Electrons |
|:----------|:---------|:--------|:---------|:----------|
| Oxygen    | 16       | 8       | 8        | 8         |
| Sodium    | 23       | 11      | 12       | 11        |
| Aluminium | 27       | 13      | 14       | 13        |
| Copper    | 64       | 29      | 35       | 29        |

## Atoms vs Ions

- Every atom is neutral (has no net charge).
- They have the same number of protons (+ve) and electrons (-ve).
- The positive charge of protons and the negative charge of electrons cancel each other out.

---

- However, an atom may lose (or gain) one or more electrons, in which case they become ‘ions’ – having a positive (or negative) charge. Losing or gaining electron(s) is called ionisation.
- Atoms are neutral, ions are charged.

# Isotopes

- Isotopes are the atoms that have the same number of protons (same atomic number)
- But different numbers of neutrons, giving them different mass numbers.
- e.g. Carbon-12, Carbon-13, Carbon-14
- (the numbers 12, 13, 14 are mass numbers)

## Pātai Rua

For Carbon-12, Carbon-13 and Carbon-14, give the number of protons, neutrons and electrons.

|           | Nucleons | Protons | Neutrons | Electrons |
|:----------|:---------|:--------|:---------|:----------|
| Carbon-12 |          |         |          |           |
| Carbon-13 |          |         |          |           |
| Carbon-14 |          |         |          |           |

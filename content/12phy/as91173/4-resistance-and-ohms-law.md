## Mahi Tuatahi / Starter

Homework booklet __Electric Fields Question Five: Static Electricity__

---

Previously we have learned about current:

\begin{aligned}
    & current = \frac{charge}{time} \newline
    & I = \frac{q}{t}
\end{aligned}

---

and voltage:

\begin{aligned}
    & voltage = \frac{\text{Electric field strength}}{charge} \newline
    & V = \frac{E}{q}
\end{aligned}

### Pātai

What is the third variable that we are missing so far?

---

## Resistance

- __Pātai/Question:__ What carries the charge in a circuit?
- __Whakatika/Answer:__ Typically, electrons ($e^{-}$)

---

- __Pātai:__ Why are they able to flow in metals?
- __Whakatika/Answer:__ Because electrons exist in a "sea", not bound to one atom but able to move around the solid

---

- __Pātai:__ What determines how fast the electrons can flow?
- __Whakatika__: _Resistance_ is the measure of how much electrons are impeded in a circuit. How much they are _slowed down_.

---

### Symbol & Units

- __Resistance__ has symbol __R__ in equations and has the unit __Ohms__ ($\Omega$, the Greek letter omega).
- Resistance is determined by the components in the circuit, and is not usually variable
- <mark>Resistance changes when components are added/removed</mark> or when a rheostat (variable resistor) is altered
- Usually <mark>voltage is also fixed</mark> by the power supply, so usually <mark>only the current change</mark>

## Resistance & Heat

When current moves through a material with resistance the electrons _bump_ into other atoms. This causes energy to be transferred in the form of vibrations (__heat__)!

- The higher the resistance, the more heat produced!
- The higher the current, the more heat produced!

## Ohm's Law

\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \newline
    & voltage = current \times resistance \newline
\end{aligned}

- Voltage is measured in:
- Current is measured in:
- Resistance is measured in:

### Pātai

1. The resistance of a light bulb is $1.5k\Omega$. Calculate the current through the bulb when it is connected across a $12V$ power supply.
2. When $9V$ is applied to a resistor, $0.03mA$ of current flows through it. Calculate the resistance of the resistor.
3. How much voltage is required to produce $180\mu A$ of current flowing through a $0.6M\Omega$ resistor?

#### Whakatika Tahi

The resistance of a light bulb is $1.5k\Omega$. Calculate the current through the bulb when it is connected across a $12V$ power supply.

\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \newline
    & I = \frac{V}{R} \newline
    & I = \frac{12}{1500} \newline
    & I = 0.008A
\end{aligned}

#### Whakatika Rua

When $9V$ is applied to a resistor, $0.03mA$ of current flows through it. Calculate the resistance of the resistor.

\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \newline
    & R = \frac{V}{I} \newline
    & R = \frac{9}{0.00003} \newline
    & R = 300000\Omega
\end{aligned}

#### Whakatika Toru

How much voltage is required to produce $180\mu A$ of current flowing through a $0.6M\Omega$ resistor?

\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \newline
    & V = (180 \times 10^{-6}) \times (0.6 \times 10^{6}) \newline
    & V = 108V
\end{aligned}

## Mahi Tuatahi / Do Now

Homework booklet __Electric Fields Question Five__

---

So far we have covered the concepts of:

- Charge carries (electrons or otherwise),
- movement of charge carriers as __current__,
- charge carriers as the movers of __energy__,
- voltage as a __difference in electric potential energy__.

__Pātai__: What is the third variable that we are missing?

## Resistance {.c2}

- Charge carries want to move around a circuit, and in a conductor they can do this easily due to the mobile electrons.
- In insulators they are not as able to move due to the less mobile electrons.
- Resistance is the idea of a _friction_ that the __current__ encounters that reduces the current able to flow, and causes energy to be lost/used as heat/light.
- In reality, everything is _a little bit_ of a resistor.

### Symbol & Units

- __Resistance__ has symbol __R__ in equations and has the unit __Ohms__ ($\Omega$, the Greek letter omega).
- <mark>Resistance changes when circuit components are added/removed</mark> or when a rheostat (variable resistor) is altered
- If <mark>supply voltage is constant, the current will increase/reduce as the resistance changes</mark>.

## Resistance & Heat

When current moves through a material with resistance the electrons _bump_ into other atoms. This causes energy to be transferred in the form of vibrations (__heat__)!

- The higher the resistance, the more heat produced!
- The higher the current, the more heat produced!

## Ohm's Law

$$
\begin{aligned}
    V &= IR \newline
    voltage &= current \times resistance
\end{aligned}
$$

- Voltage is measured in:
- Current is measured in:
- Resistance is measured in:

### Pātai

1. The resistance of a light bulb is $1.5k\Omega$. Calculate the current through the bulb when it is connected across a $12V$ power supply.
2. When $9V$ is applied to a resistor, $0.03mA$ of current flows through it. Calculate the resistance of the resistor.
3. How much voltage is required to produce $180\mu A$ of current flowing through a $0.6M\Omega$ resistor?

#### Whakatika Tahi

The resistance of a light bulb is $1.5k\Omega$. Calculate the current through the bulb when it is connected across a $12V$ power supply.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \newline
    & I = \frac{V}{R} \newline
    & I = \frac{12}{1500} \newline
    & I = 0.008A
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Whakatika Rua

When $9V$ is applied to a resistor, $0.03mA$ of current flows through it. Calculate the resistance of the resistor.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \newline
    & R = \frac{V}{I} \newline
    & R = \frac{9}{0.00003} \newline
    & R = 300000\Omega
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Whakatika Toru

How much voltage is required to produce $180\mu A$ of current flowing through a $0.6M\Omega$ resistor?

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \newline
    & V = (180 \times 10^{-6}) \times (0.6 \times 10^{6}) \newline
    & V = 108V
\end{aligned}

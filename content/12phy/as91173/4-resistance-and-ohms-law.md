# Mahi Tuatahi

Give the definition, symbol, unit and formula for the following:

1. Electric Potential Energy
2. Current
3. Voltage
4. Power

---

Recall that a circuit is an energy delivery system!

## Curent
\begin{aligned}
    & current = \frac{charge}{time} \\
    & I = \frac{q}{t}
\end{aligned}

---

## Voltage
\begin{aligned}
    & voltage = \frac{\text{Electric field strength}}{charge} \\
    & V = \frac{E}{q}
\end{aligned}

---

## Power

\begin{aligned}
    & power = current \times voltage \\
    & P = IV
\end{aligned}

What are we missing?

# Resistance

- __Q:__ What carries the charge in a circuit?
- __A:__ Typically, electrons ($e^{-}$)

---

- __Q:__ Why are they able to flow in metals?
- __A:__ Because electrons exist in a "sea", not bound to one atom but able to move around the solid

---

- __Q:__ What is resistance?
- __Resistance__ is the measure of how much electrons are impeded in a circuit. How much they are _slowed down_.

---

## Symbol & Units

__Resistance__ has symbol __R__ in equations and has the unit __Ohms__ ($\Omega$, the Greek letter omega).

---

## Resistance & Heat

When current moves through a material with resistance the electrons _bump_ into the nuclei. This causes energy to be transferred in the form of vibrations (__heat__)!

The higher the resistance, the more heat produced!

## Ohm's Law

\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \\
    & voltage = current \times resistance \\
\end{aligned}

- Voltage is measured in..
- Current is measured in..
- Resistance is measured in..

### Pﾄ》ai

1. The resistance of a light bulb is $1.5k\Omega$. Calculate the current through the bulb when it is connected across a $12V$ power supply.
2. When $9V$ is applied to a resistor, $0.03mA$ of current flows through it. Calculate the resistance of the resistor.
3. How much voltage is required to produce $180\mu A$ of current flowing through a $0.6M\Omega$ resistor?

### Pﾄ》ai Tahi Answer

\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \\
    & I = \frac{V}{R} \\
    & I = \frac{12}{1500} \\
    & I = 0.008A \\
\end{aligned}

### Pﾄ》ai Rua Answer

\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \\
    & R = \frac{V}{I} \\
    & R = \frac{9}{0.00003} \\
    & R = 300000\Omega \\
\end{aligned}

#### Pﾄ》ai Toru Answer

\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \\
    & V = (180 \times 10^{-6}) \times (0.6 \times 10^{6}) \\
    & V = 108V \\
\end{aligned}

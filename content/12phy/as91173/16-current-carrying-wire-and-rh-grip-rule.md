## Magnetic Force: Wires

Instead of thinking about individual particles, we can think about the aggregate of them as current in a wire.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Force &= B-Field \times Current \times Length \newline
    F &= BIL
\end{aligned}
$$

## Current in Magnetic Field

- When a current-carrying wire is placed in a magnetic field it will experience a force.
- We can use the RH slap rule to deermine the direction of the force experienced by the current-carrying wire.

## Electromagnetism

Electric and magnetic fields are different sides of the same coin, and one can create the other. Our first example is the current-carrying wire.

- Collect a Current-Carrying Wire sheet
- Come up the front where you can observe the setup.
- Illustrate the direction of the compasses without current, and with current going both directions.
- Use the RH grip rule to determine and illustrate the corresponding current and field directions.

## Current-Carrying Wire {.c2}

- Magnetic fields exist around current carrying wires
- The magnetic field is circular around the wire
- The direction of the field depends on a right hand rule!

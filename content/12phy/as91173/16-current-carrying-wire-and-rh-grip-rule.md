## Formula: F=BIL

Instead of thinking about the velocity of the moving charges, we can also think about the current and length of wire in the magnetic field.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Force &= B-Field \times Current \times Length \newline
    F &= BIL
\end{aligned}
$$

## Electromagnetism

Electric and magnetic fields are different sides of the same coin, and one can create the other. Our first example is current-carrying wire.

- Collect a Current-Carrying Wire sheet
- Come up the front where you can observe the setup.
- Illustrate the direction of the compasses without current, and with current going both directions.
- Use the RH grip rule to determine and illustrate the corresponding current and field directions.

## Current-Carrying Wire {.c2}

- Magnetic fields exist around current carrying wires
- The magnetic field is circular around the wire
- The direction of the field depends on a right hand rule!

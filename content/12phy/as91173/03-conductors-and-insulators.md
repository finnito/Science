## Charge (Q)

- In Physics the symbol for charge in equations is $q$ or $Q$.
- __Unit__: Coulombs (C) (amount of electrical charge)
- We use it to describe how positive or negative an object is.

---

### Pātai: What is a Coulomb?

- We know that electrons are negatively charged. In fact, they have a charge of $-0.000,000,000,000,000,000,16C$
- __Pātai__: Write this number in scientific form (e.g. $1\times10^{5}$)

---

#### Whakatika

- $q_{e} = -0.000,000,000,000,000,000,16 C =-1.6 \times  10^{-19}C$.
- __Pātai__: How many electrons are needed to carry $1C$ of charge?

---

#### Whakatika

$$
\begin{aligned}
    num_{e} &= \frac{Q_{total}}{q_{e}} \newline
    num_{e} &= \frac{1}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \newline
    num_{e} &= 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 = 6.25 \times 10^{18}
\end{aligned}
$$

$6.25 \times 10^{18} electrons = -1 C$

> $1C$ is the amount of charge carried by $6.25 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.

### Pātai

1. If a balloon has charge of $-3C$ did the balloon lose or gain electrons, and how many?
2. If Charlotte has charge of $0.2C$ did she lose or gain electrons and how many?

---

#### Whakatika Tahi

If a balloon has charge of $-3C$: did the balloon lose or gain electrons, and how many?

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \text{Negative C} \rightarrow \text{electrons gained (-ve charge)} \newline
    & num_{e} = 3 \times (6.25 \times 10^{18}) \newline
    & num_{e} = 1.875 \times 10^{19} && \text{ electrons gained}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

#### Whakatika Rua

If Charlotte has charge of $0.2C$ did she lose or gain electrons and how many?

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Positive C} &\rightarrow \text{electrons lost (+ve charge)} \newline
    num_{e} &= 0.2 \times (6.25 \times 10^{18}) \newline
    num_{e} &= 1.25 \times 10^{18} \text{ electrons lost}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Conductors

- A conductor is a material through which charge can move freely
- E.g. Metals because they have a _delocalised sea of electrons_
- Have equal distributions of charge

---

## Insulators {.c2}

- A material through which electrons cannot easily flow
- The electrons encounter a large friction force when trying to move
- This friction causes heat to build up
- e.g. Wood can catch fire if current is applied
- Can have uneven distributions of charge

## Current

- Current is the flow of charge (often electrons).
- It is the measure of the rate at which the charge flows (Amperes).
- __Recall:__ $1C$ of charge is $6.25\times10^{18}$ electrons

### What Direction Does Current Flow?

### Conventional Current

- Back in the old days they thought current was the flow of _positive_ charge, but these days we know it is the flow of _negative charge_
- This is because protons (positive) are fixed inside the nucleus of an atom and nuclei cannot move, whereas electrons (negative) can move freely in some materials

---

- Conventional current is the direction that positive charges move in a circuit. From the positive terminal to the negative terminal.
- However, electrons _actually_ move from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, which is __opposite__ to _conventional current_.

### Whakatika

1. If a balloon has charge of $-0.5C$: did the balloon lose or gain electrons, and how many?

\begin{aligned}
    & \text{Negative C means electrons are gained (negative charge)} \newline
    num_{e} &= \frac{-0.5}{-1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \newline
    num_{e} &= 3.125 \times 10^{18} && \text{ electrons gained}
\end{aligned}

2. If a Van der Graaff generator has charge of $4C$ did it lose or gain electrons, and how many?

\begin{aligned}
    & \text{Positive C means electrons are lost (positive charge)} \newline
    num_{e} &= \frac{4}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \newline
    num_{e} &= 2.5 \times 10^{19} && \text{ electrons lost}

## Electric Fields

> An electric field is an area of influence in which a <mark>charged</mark> object will feel a force

- A field can exist in a vacuum or inside an substance.
- An electric field exists in the space around a charged objects e.g. Van der Graaf generator, electrons, protons or a charged balloon.

---

- The closer you are to a field source (e.g. the charged particle), the greater the force exerted by the field
- The field extends out to infinity, but the strength diminishes exponentially

### Representing Fields on Paper {.c2}

- We draw electric fields as a series of arrows, which indicate direction
- By convention the fields goes <mark>from positive to negative</mark>
- Lines close together indicate a strong field
- Lines far apart indicate a weak field
- We can see the lines are closer together near the charge, indicating a stronger field!

### Electric Fields & Forces

- Electric fields exert a force on charged objects & particles.
- Charged particles are simultaneously repelled by their similarly charged terminal, and attracted by their oppositely charged terminal.

\begin{aligned}
    \vec{E} &= \frac{\vec{F}}{q} \newline
    \text{Electric Field Strength} &= \frac{Force}{Charge} \newline
\end{aligned}

Therefore $\vec{E}$ has units of $\frac{N}{C}$ or $NC^{-1}$

---

### Pātai

Is electric field strength a scalar or a vector?

---

#### Whakatika

<mark>It is a vector</mark>, because one of the components that creates it is __force__, and force has both direction and magnitude. Because it is a vector we can give it the notation $\vec{E}$. You can use this notation with any other vector, too.

### $\vec{E}$ Pātai Tahi

    &  && \text{(U)} \newline
    &  && \text{(F)} \newline
    &  && \text{(S+S)} 
\end{aligned}

### $\vec{E}$ Pātai Tahi: Whakatika

A small charge of $2\times10^{-4}C$ experiences a force of $1.5\times10^{-4}N$. Calculate the electric field strength.

\begin{aligned}
    & \vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q} \newline
    & \vec{E} = \frac{1.5\times10^{-4}}{2\times10^{-4}} \newline
    & \vec{E} = 0.75NC^{-1}
\end{aligned}

## Akoranga 8 Mahi Tuatahi

1. Define _electric field_
2. Calculate the force experienced by the object inside the electric field, and indicate direction

---

### Whakatika

1. An area of influence in where a charged object will feel a force
2. \begin{aligned}
    & \vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q} \newline
    & 3000 = \frac{\vec{F}}{25 \times 10^{-6}} \newline
    & \vec{F} = 3000 \times 25 \times 10^{-6} \newline
    & \vec{F} = 0.075N
\end{aligned}

## Electric Potential Energy

Electric potential energy is akin to gravitational potential energy. Moving a charged particle against the direction of the field is similar to lifting an object up in a gravitational potential field.

Therefore, different points in an electric field will have different _potential energies_

Gravity Field:

\begin{aligned}
    & W = F \times d \newline
    & W = mg \times h \newline
    & W = mgh = E_{p-grav}
\end{aligned}

---

Electric Field:

\begin{aligned}
    & W = F \times d \newline
    & W = Eq \times d \newline
    & W = Eqd = E_{p-elec}
\end{aligned}

---

### Voltage

> The difference in electric potential energy between two points

OR

> The work needed per unit charge to move a test charge between two points.

\begin{aligned}
    V &= \frac{E_{p}}{q} \newline
    \text{Field Voltage} &= \frac{\text{Potential Energy}}{\text{Charge}}
\end{aligned}

---

### Mahi Tuatahi Continued

An object with charge $-25 \times 10^{-6}C$ is placed in an electric field with strength $3000NC^{-1}$.

3. In the object moves __against__ the field by $2m$, does it gain or lose electric potential energy? And how much?

---

#### Whakatika

Because it moves against the field, it gains electric potential energy.

\begin{aligned}
    & E_{p} = Eqd \newline
    & E_{p} = 3000 \times 25 \times 10^{-6} \times 2 \newline
    & E_{p} = 0.15J
\end{aligned}

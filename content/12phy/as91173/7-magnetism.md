## Mahi Tuatahi

1. If an object has a charge of $0.03C$, how many electrons has it lost?
2. There is $80mA$ of current flowing through a $2k\Omega$ resistor. How many electrons are going through the resistor in one second?
3. What is the power output of the resistor?

## Pātai: What is an electric field?

Think, pair and share!

- _A region in which a charged object experiences a force_

---

## What is a magnetic field?

- _A region in which a moving charged object experiences a force_

---

The force ($F$) that the charge experiences as it moves through the field depends on three things:

- Magnetic field strength ($B$, measured in Tesla ($T$))
- Charge of the object ($q$, measured in Coulombs ($C$))
- Velocity of the object ($v$, measured in $ms^{-1}$)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F = Bqv
\end{aligned}
$$

---

Let's summarise:

__Electric Field:__ A region in which a charged object experiences a force $F=Eq$

__Magnetic Field:__ A region in which a moving charged object experiences a force $F=Bqv$

### Why Do Magnetic Fields Form? {.c2}

- _A model that will help us understand is as follows_:
- The valence electrons of each atom have some small magnetic component to them
- When all of the atoms are aligned, their magnetic fields all add up to a much stronger/larger field

### Ferromagnets and Paramagnets

- Ferromagnet: A material where the atoms are all aligned to create a permanent magnetic field
    + E.g. Iron, nickel, cobalt, and their alloys
- Paramagnets: A material with disorderly atoms, but that can become aligned when exposed to a strong external magnetic field.
    + E.g. Platinum, aluminium, oxygen

### Pātai

A narrow beam of protons ($1.6\times10^{-19}C$) moving at a speed of $2.0\times10^{-6}ms^{-1}$, enters a uniform magnetic field of strength $0.20T$.

Calculate the magnetic force applied on each proton.

#### Whakatika

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & F = Bqv \newline
    & F = 0.2 \times 1.6\times10^{-19} \times 2.0\times10^{-6} \newline
    & F = 6.4 \times 10^{-26}N

## Right Hand Slap Rule (+ve Charges)

> Thumb in the direction of positive charge velocity, finger-tips indicate the $B$ field strength, and the __palm__ shows the direction of force on the positive charge.

![[Source](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/magnetic-forces-and-magnetic-fields/magnets-magnetic/a/what-is-magnetic-force)](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/118077fe81209c4c6b5be3e78c42f9a70682037a.svg)

---

### Back-Hand Slap Rule (-ve Charges)

> Thumb in the direction of __NEGATIVE__ charge velocity, finger-tips indicate the $B$ field strength, and the __back of the hand__ shows the direction of force on the __NEGATIVE__ charge.

By default we use the +ve charge rule because we tend to think about __conventional current__ (the flow of +ve charge).

---

### Pātai

__For each of these four situations, apply the RH rule and figure out what direction the current feels a force.__ Fingers go in direction of field and thumb in direction of current.

A cross means current going into the page down a wire; a dot means current coming out of the page.

#### Whakatika

1. Force out of the page
2. Force into the page
3. Force down
4. Force up

---

### Pātai

A charged object ($q=1.6\times10^{-19}C$) moves to the left across a magnetic field (going bottom to top of the page) with a speed of $4.0\times10^{3}ms^{-1}$. The magnetic field strength is $12T$.

1. Draw a diagram and illustrate the magnetic field lines
2. Calculate the force applied to the charged object
3. Describe/draw the direction of the force applied

## Formula: F=BIL

Instead of thinking about the velocity of the moving charges, we can think about the current and length of wire in the magnetic field.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Force &= B Field \times Current \times Length \newline
    F &= BIL
\end{aligned}
$$

## Current-Carrying Wire {.c2}

- Magnetic fields exist around current carrying wires
- The magnetic field is circular around the wire
- The direction of the field depends on a right hand rule!

## Solenoids {.c2}

- A solenoid is a coil of wire, which generates a strong magnetic field
- The more coils, the stronger the field!
- Use the solenoid right hand rule to determine the direction of the field
    + Your fingers curl in the direction of flow of positive charge! Thumb indicates the N end of the solenoid

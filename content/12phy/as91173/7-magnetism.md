## Mahi Tuatahi 1

If an object has a charge of $0.03C$, how many electrons has it lost?

__Hint:__ Charge of one electron $=-1.6\times10^{-19}C$

---

## Mahi Tuatahi 1 Answer

\begin{aligned}
    & n = \frac{0.03}{1.6\times10^{-19}} \newline
    & n = 1.875\times10^{17}
\end{aligned}

---

## Mahi Tuatahi 2

There is $80mA$ of current flowing through a $2k\Omega$ resistor.

1. How many electrons are going through the resistor in one second?
2. What is the power output of the resistor?

---

## Mahi Tuatahi 2 Answer

\begin{aligned}
    & I = \frac{q}{t} \newline
    & It = q \newline
    & q = 0.08 \times 1 = 0.08C \newline
    & n = \frac{0.08}{1.6\times^{-19}} = 5\times10^{17}
\end{aligned}

\begin{aligned}
    & P = IV, V = IR\newline
    & P = I^{2}R \newline
    & P = 0.08^{2} \times 2000 = 12.8W (Js^{-1})
\end{aligned}

## Pﾄ》ai: What is an electric field?

Think, pair and share!

- _A region in which a charged object experiences a force_

---

## What is a magnetic field?

- _A region in which a moving charged object experiences a force_

---

The force ($F$) that the charge experiences as it moves through the field depends on three things:

- Magnetic field strength ($B$, measured in Tesla ($T$))
- Charge of the object ($q$, measured in Coulombs ($C$))
- Velocity of the object ($v$, measured in $ms^{-1}$)

\begin{aligned}
    F = Bqv
\end{aligned}

---

Let's summarise:

__Electric Field:__ A region in which a charged object experiences a force $F=Eq$

__Magnetic Field:__ A region in which a moving charged object experiences a force $F=Bqv$

### Why Do Fields Form? {.c2}

- _A model that will help us understand is as follows_:
- The valence electrons of each atom have some small magnetic component to them
- When all of the atoms are aligned, their magnetic fields all add up to a much stronger/larger field

### Ferromagnets and Paramagnets

- Ferromagnet: A material where the atoms are all aligned to create a permanent magnetic field
    + E.g. Iron, nickel, cobalt, and their alloys
- Paramagnets: A material with disorderly atoms, but that can become aligned when exposed to a strong external magnetic field.
    + E.g. Platinum, aluminium, oxygen

### Question

A narrow beam of protons ($1.6\times10^{-19}C$) moving at a speed of $2.0\times10^{-6}ms^{-1}$, enters a uniform magnetic field of strength $0.20T$.

Calculate the magnetic force applied on each proton.

---

#### Answer

\begin{aligned}
    & F = Bqv \newline
    & F = 0.2 \times 1.6\times10^{-19} \times 2.0\times10^{-6} \newline
    & F = 6.4 \times 10^{-26}N
\end{aligned}

## Right Hand Rules

<p class="instruction">Collect and glue in your sheet of right hand rules somewhere you can find it. These are very important and useful!</p>

---

## Right Hand Slap Rule (+ve Charges)

> Thumb in the direction of positive charge velocity, finger-tips indicate the $B$ field strength, and the __palm__ shows the direction of force on the positive charge.

---

### Back-Hand Slap Rule (-ve Charges)

> Thumb in the direction of __NEGATIVE__ charge velocity, finger-tips indicate the $B$ field strength, and the __back of the hand__ shows the direction of force on the __NEGATIVE__ charge.

---

## Pﾄ》ai

A charged object ($q=1.6\times10^{-19}C$) moves across a magnetic field with a speed of $4.0\times10^{3}ms^{-1}$. The magnetic field strength is $12T$.

1. Draw a diagram and illustrate the magnetic field lines
2. Calculate the force applied to the charged object
3. Describe/draw the direction of the force applied

---

Which direction is the force acting in?

## Formula: F=BvL

Instead of thinking about the velocity of the moving charges, we can think about the current and length of wire in the magnetic field.

\begin{aligned}
    Force &= B Field \times Current \times Length \newline
    F &= BIL
\end{aligned}

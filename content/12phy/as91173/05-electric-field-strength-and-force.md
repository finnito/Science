### Electric Fields & Forces

- Electric fields exert a force on charged matter.
- Charged particles are simultaneously repelled by their similarly charged terminal, and attracted by their oppositely charged terminal.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Electric Field Strength} &= \frac{Force}{Charge} \newline
    E &= \frac{F}{q} \newline
    E &= \frac{N}{C} = NC^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore $E$ has units of $\frac{N}{C}$ ($NC^{-1}$).

### Pātai

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E &= \frac{F}{q} \newline
\end{aligned}
$$

Is electric field strength a scalar or a vector?

---

#### Whakatika

<mark>It is a vector</mark>, because one of the components that creates it is ,__force__, is a vector. This means that $E$ fields have both strength (magnitude) and direction.

    E &= \frac{V}{d}
\end{aligned}
$$

1. What is the effect of increasing/decreasing voltage on the electric field strength?
2. What is the effect of increasing/decreasing plate separation on the electric field strength?

#### Whakatika

1. Increasing voltage will increase the field strength (with constant plate separation)
2. Decreasing voltage will decrease the field strength (with constant plate separation)
3. Increasing plate separation will decrease the field strength (with constant voltage)
4. Decreasing plate separation will increase the field strength (with constant voltage)

#### Whakatika

1. At the extremes there are a large number of charges on each plate. When the voltage reaches zero, there zero net charge on each plate. When the voltage crosses through to the other side the type of net charge swaps.
2. At the extremes (1.5, -1.5) there is maximum voltage and therefore strongest field. Reducing voltage reduces field strength. Zero voltage means zero field strength.
3. At constant voltage, increasing plate separates spaces out the field lines indicating a weaker field. Decreasing plate separation condenses the lines indicating a stronger field. -->

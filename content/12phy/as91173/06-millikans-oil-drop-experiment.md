## Millikan's Oil Drop Experiment {.c2}

![[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Robert-millikan2.jpg)

- In the early 1900s we did not know what the charge of the electron was
- Millikan figured that <mark>if the force exerted by an electric field was strong enough, it could _balance_ the weight force due to gravity</mark>
- <mark>By measuring the field strength needed to balance many different droplets of charged oil, he figured out that the charges were multiples of $1.5924(17)\times10^{âˆ’19}C$!</mark>

## [Styrofoam Balls](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18CnDWpo-05z72rtvTztYuwp9SvlM_N1OlUIsGH7a-7c/edit#)

- Collect a Styrofoam Balls and Electric Fields sheet from the front.
- Come up the front and observe the behaviour of the balls as the voltage is varied.
- Use your observations and our discussion to answer Task 1-2.

### Ngohe/Task

Homework booklet Electric Fields A5

---

In 1909 Millikan used two oppositely charged metal plates to keep a charged oil drop falling at terminal velocity when he was experimenting to find the charge of an electron. A modified form of his experiment keeps an oil drop stationary. 

__d) Discuss how it was possible to make the oil drop stationary between the plates. (E)__

In your comprehensive answer you should:

- identify the forces acting on the oil drop 
- describe how the forces can combine to cause the oil drop to be stationary 
- explain what type of charge the oil drop must have in order to remain stationary.

### Whakatika

- Achieved:
    + Identifies the two forces
    + OR says that the forces must be balanced
    + OR Top plate should be positive and the charge on the oil must be negative, or vice versa.
- Merit:
    + Identifies the forces AND that the forces must be balanced, as the charged drop is stationary.
- Excellence:
    + Explain that the electrical force must be upwards to balance the downward weight force, as the oil drop is stationary
    + AND For the electric force to be upwards, the charge on the oil drop must be negative.

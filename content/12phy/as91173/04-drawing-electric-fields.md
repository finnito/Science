## Mahi Tuatahi

1. If a balloon has charge of $-0.5C$: did the balloon lose or gain electrons, and how many?
2. If a Van der Graaff generator has charge of $4C$ did it lose or gain electrons, and how many?

### Whakatika Tahi

1. If a balloon has charge of $-0.5C$: did the balloon lose or gain electrons, and how many?

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \text{Negative C means electrons are gained (negative charge)} \newline
    num_{e} &= \frac{-0.5}{-1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \newline
    num_{e} &= 3.125 \times 10^{18} \text{ electrons gained}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Whakatika Rua

2. If a Van der Graaff generator has charge of $4C$ did it lose or gain electrons, and how many?

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \text{Positive C means electrons are lost (positive charge)} \newline
    num_{e} &= \frac{4}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \newline
    num_{e} &= 2.5 \times 10^{19} \text{ electrons lost}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Electric Fields

> An electric field is an area of influence in which a <mark>charged object will feel a force</mark>.

- A field can exist in a vacuum or inside matter.
- An electric field exists in the space around a charged objects e.g. Van der Graaf generator, electrons, protons or a charged balloon.

### Drawing Fields {.c2}

- We draw electric fields as a series of arrows
- By convention the fields goes <mark>from positive to negative</mark>
    + __Test Charge__: A positively charged object
    + Arrows indicate the direction that a test charge will feel a force
- Lines close together indicate a strong field
- Lines far apart indicate a weak field

### Tūhura / Investigation

Create a grid of six boxes in your book using the whole page.

1. Positive Charge
2. Negative Charge
3. Two Positive Charges
4. Two Opposite Charges
5. Two positively charged parallel plates
6. Two oppositely charged parallel plates

__Use the simulation on Google Classroom to help you discover the fields for the first four, and use the grid function and five of each charge equally spaced to mimic two plates.__

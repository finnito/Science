### Pātai/Question

- Recall $F=Bqv$
- What happens if we take a wire and we move it through a magnetic field?

#### Whakatika {.c2}

1. The charged particles (electrons) are now moving through an electric field, and therefore feel a force!
2. The force exerted on the moving electrons by the magnetic field will cause them to accelerate and therefore to move
3. If the circuit is complete: 
    a. Moving electrons is known as a __induced current__!
    b. Moving electrons will cause an unequal distribution (difference in potential), known as __induced voltage__.

### Inductors Summary

> Moving charges through a magnetic field will cause them to feel a force (due to the magnetic field). Thus creating an __induced voltage__.

> In a complete circuit, this is seen as a __induced current__.

## Induced Voltage

> Exists in a conductor moving through a magnetic field in a perpendicular direction.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & V=BvL
\end{aligned}
$$

- $V$ is the induced voltage (V, Volts)
- $B$ is the magnetic field strength (T, Tesla)
- $v$ is the velocity of the wire ($ms^{-1}$)
- $L$ is the length of wire in the field ($m$)

### Pātai

A metal rod is moved in a magnetic field. The rod is $24cm$ long and moves at $8ms^{-1}$ through a magnetic field with strength $0.7T$.

1. Calculate the __induced voltage__
2. Calculate the __induced current__ and indicate direction

#### Whakatika

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & V = BvL \newline
    & V = 0.7 \times 8 \times 0.24 \newline
    & V = 1.344V
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \newline
    & I = \frac{V}{R} \newline
    & I = \frac{1.344}{10} = 0.1344A
\end{aligned}
$$

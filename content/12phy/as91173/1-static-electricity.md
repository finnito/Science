# Mahi Tuatahi

Take 5 minutes and brainstorm in your book all the things that you can remember off the top of your head about electricity from Year 10 Pūtaiao.

# Static Electricity

Static electricity has many effects - some dangerous, some hilarious, but they all depend on charge!

## Charges: Positive & Negative

From Year 10 we should all remember that, much like magnets, opposites attract and likes repel.

## Charge Carriers

Recall: __the atom__. What element is this? What are the three subatomic particles that make it up?

---

- __Electrons__: Negatively charged
- __Protons__: Positively charged
- __Neutrons__: No charge

__Question__: What happens when an atom loses or gains electrons?

---

## Ions

Electrons are extremely light and move very fast. Therefore they can sometimes escape an atom.

- An ion is formed when an atom gains or loses electrons.
- Losing one or more electrons makes you __positively charged__ and is called a __cation__.
- Gaining one or more electrons makes you __negatively charged__ and is called an __anion__.

### Question 1

What did we do in Year 10 Pūtaiao to remove charges from one object and put them onto another?

---

### Question 1: Answer

We applied friction!

# What is Charge?

- In Physics the symbol for charge in equations is $q$ or $Q$.
- __Unit__: Coulomb (C)
- We use it to describe how positive or negative an object is.

---

## What's a Coulomb?

- We know that electrons are negatively charged. In fact, they have a charge of $-0.00000000000000000016 Coulombs$
- Write this number in scientific form (answer on the next kiriata)

---

- $-0.00000000000000000016 C =-1.6 \times  10^{-19}C$.
- Therefore we can calculate that if an object has a charge of +1C, is has lost $6,250,000,000,000,000,000$ electrons.
- $6.25 \times 10^{18} electrons = -1 C$

---

## Question 2

If a balloon has charge of $-3C$: did the balloon lose or gain electrons, and how many?

---

\begin{align*}
    & \text{Negative C -> electrons gained (-ve charge)} \newline
    & num_{e} = 3 \times (6.25 \times 10^{18}) \newline
    & num_{e} = 1.875 \times 10^{19} && \text{ electrons gained}
\end{align*}

---

## Question 3

If Charlotte has charge of $0.2C$ did she lose or gain electrons and how many?

---

\begin{align*}
    & \text{Positive C -> electrons lost (+ve charge)} \newline
    & num_{e} = 0.2 \times (6.25 \times 10^{18}) \newline
    & num_{e} = 1.25 \times 10^{18} && \text{ electrons lost}
\end{align*}

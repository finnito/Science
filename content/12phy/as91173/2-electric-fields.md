### Electric Fields & Forces

- Electric fields exert a force on charged matter.
- Charged particles are simultaneously repelled by their similarly charged terminal, and attracted by their oppositely charged terminal.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Electric Field Strength} &= \frac{Force}{Charge} \newline
    E &= \frac{F}{q} \newline
    E &= \frac{N}{C} = NC^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore $E$ has units of $\frac{N}{C}$ or $NC^{-1}$

### Whakatika

Hamish connects a circuit comprised of a 6.0 V battery, 1.0 m of Nichrome resistance wire and two connecting wires. The battery produces a uniform electric field in the Nichrome resistance wire. _Assume that the connecting wires have no resistance._

__(a) Calculate the strength of the electric field in the Nichrome resistance wire. (A)__

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & V=6V, d=1m && \text{(K)} \newline
    & E=? && \text{(U)} \newline
    & E = \frac{V}{d} && \text{(F)} \newline
    & E = \frac{6}{1} = 6Vm^{-1} && \text{(S+S)} 
\end{aligned}
$$

---

__(b) Explain what happens to the size of the electric force on an electron as it travels through the Nichrome resistance wire. (M)__

Throughout the wire the field strength is constant, and the charge on the electron is also constant. Therefore using $F=Eq$ we can see that the force is also constant.

---

__(c) Calculate the distance moved by an electron as it loses 9.6 × 10-20 J of electrical potential energy. (M)__

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & W = 9.6\times10^{-20}J, E = 6Vm^{-1}, q=-1.6\times10^{-19}&& \text{(K)} \newline
    & d = ? && \text{(U)} \newline
    & W = Fd = Eqd && \text{(F)} \newline
    & 9.6\times10^{-20} = 6 \times (-1.6\times10^{-19}) \times d && \text{(S+S)} \newline
    & d = \frac{9.6\times10^{-20}}{6 \times (-1.6\times10^{-19})} = 0.1m
\end{aligned}
$$

---

__(d) Hamish then adds another 6.0 V battery in series AND shortens the wire to 0.50 m. Write a comprehensive explanation on what will happen to the size of the force on the electron. (E) Calculations are not needed.__

- Adding another $6V$ battery will double the electric field strength according to $E = {V}{d}$.
- Shortening the wire from $1m$ to $0.5m$ will also double the field strength according to $E = {V}{d}$.
- Both of these factors will result in a 4x stronger electric field.
- Assuming the charge of the electron stays constant, according to $F=Eq$, the force experienced will also be 4x stronger.

## Millikan's Oil Drop Experiment {.c2}

![[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Robert-millikan2.jpg)

- In the early 1900s we did not know what the charge of the electron was
- Millikan figured that if the force exerted by an electric field was strong enough, it could _balance_ the weight force due to gravity
- By measuring the field strength needed to balance many different droplets of charged oil, he figured out that the charges were multiples of $1.5924(17)\times10^{−19}C$!

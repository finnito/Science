## Electric Fields

> An electric field is an area of influence in which a <mark>charged</mark> object will feel a force

- A field can exist in a vacuum or inside an substance.
- An electric field exists in the space around a charged objects e.g. Van der Graaf generator, electrons, protons or a charged balloon.

---

- The closer you are to a field source (e.g. the charged particle), the greater the force exerted by the field
- The field extends out to infinity, but the strength diminishes exponentially

### Representing Fields on Paper {.c2}

- We draw electric fields as a series of arrows, which indicate direction
- By convention the fields goes <mark>from positive to negative</mark>
- Lines close together indicate a strong field
- Lines far apart indicate a weak field
- We can see the lines are closer together near the charge, indicating a stronger field!

### Electric Fields & Forces

- Electric fields exert a force on charged objects & particles.
- Charged particles are simultaneously repelled by their similarly charged terminal, and attracted by their oppositely charged terminal.

\begin{aligned}
    \vec{E} &= \frac{\vec{F}}{q} \newline
    \text{Electric Field Strength} &= \frac{Force}{Charge} \newline
\end{aligned}

Therefore $\vec{E}$ has units of $\frac{N}{C}$ or $NC^{-1}$

---

### Pātai

Is electric field strength a scalar or a vector?

---

#### Whakatika

<mark>It is a vector</mark>, because one of the components that creates it is __force__, and force has both direction and magnitude. Because it is a vector we can give it the notation $\vec{E}$. You can use this notation with any other vector, too.

#### Whakatika

## Electric Potential Energy

Electric potential energy is akin to gravitational potential energy. Moving a charged particle against the direction of the field is similar to lifting an object up in a gravitational potential field.

Therefore, different points in an electric field will have different _potential energies_

Gravity Field:

\begin{aligned}
    & W = F \times d \newline
    & W = mg \times h \newline
    & W = mgh = E_{p-grav}
\end{aligned}

---

Electric Field:

\begin{aligned}
    & W = F \times d \newline
    & W = Eq \times d \newline
    & W = Eqd = E_{p-elec}
\end{aligned}

---

### Voltage

> The difference in electric potential energy between two points

OR

> The work needed per unit charge to move a test charge between two points.

\begin{aligned}
    V &= \frac{E_{p}}{q} \newline
    \text{Field Voltage} &= \frac{\text{Potential Energy}}{\text{Charge}}
\end{aligned}

---

### Mahi Tuatahi Continued

An object with charge $-25 \times 10^{-6}C$ is placed in an electric field with strength $3000NC^{-1}$.

3. In the object moves __against__ the field by $2m$, does it gain or lose electric potential energy? And how much?

---

#### Whakatika

Because it moves against the field, it gains electric potential energy.

\begin{aligned}
    & E_{p} = Eqd \newline
    & E_{p} = 3000 \times 25 \times 10^{-6} \times 2 \newline
    & E_{p} = 0.15J
\end{aligned}

### Whakatika

Hamish connects a circuit comprised of a 6.0 V battery, 1.0 m of Nichrome resistance wire and two connecting wires. The battery produces a uniform electric field in the Nichrome resistance wire. _Assume that the connecting wires have no resistance._

__(a) Calculate the strength of the electric field in the Nichrome resistance wire. (A)__

\begin{aligned}
    & V=6V, d=1m && \text{(K)} \newline
    & \vec{E}=? && \text{(U)} \newline
    & \vec{E} = \frac{V}{d} && \text{(F)} \newline
    & \vec{E} = \frac{6}{1} = 6Vm^{-1} && \text{(S+S)} 
\end{aligned}

---

__(b) Explain what happens to the size of the electric force on an electron as it travels through the Nichrome resistance wire. (M)__

Throughout the wire the field strength is constant, and the charge on the electron is also constant. Therefore using $F=\vec{E}q$ we can see that the force is also constant.

---

__(c) Calculate the distance moved by an electron as it loses 9.6 × 10-20 J of electrical potential energy. (M)__

\begin{aligned}
    & W = 9.6\times10^{-20}J, \vec{E} = 6Vm^{-1}, q=-1.6\times10^{-19}&& \text{(K)} \newline
    & d = ? && \text{(U)} \newline
    & W = Fd = Eqd && \text{(F)} \newline
    & 9.6\times10^{-20} = 6 \times (-1.6\times10^{-19}) \times d && \text{(S+S)} \newline
    & d = \frac{9.6\times10^{-20}}{6 \times (-1.6\times10^{-19})} = 0.1m
\end{aligned}

---

__(d) Hamish then adds another 6.0 V battery in series AND shortens the wire to 0.50 m. Write a comprehensive explanation on what will happen to the size of the force on the electron. (E) _Calculations are not needed.___

- Adding another $6V$ battery will double the electric field strength according to $\vec{E} = {V}{d}$.
- Shortening the wire from $1m$ to $0.5m$ will also double the field strength according to $\vec{E} = {V}{d}$.
- Both of these factors will result in a 4x stronger electric field.
- Assuming the charge of the electron stays constant, according to $F=\vec{E}q$, the force experienced will also be 4x stronger.

## Millikan's Oil Drop Experiment {.c2}

![[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Robert-millikan2.jpg)

- In the early 1900s we did not know what the charge of the electron was
- Millikan figured that if the force exerted by an electric field was strong enough, it could _balance_ the weight force due to gravity
- By measuring the field strength needed to balance many different droplets of charged oil, he figured out that the charges were multiples of $1.5924(17)\times10^{−19}C$!

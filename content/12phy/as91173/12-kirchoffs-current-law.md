## Kirchoff's Laws: Current {.c2}

<div>
These laws were first determined experimentally, but we now know them as __conservation of charge__.

> The sum of current flowing into a junction is equal to the sum of current flowing out of it.

In this circuit, $A_{1} = A_{2} + A_{3} + A_{4}$.

## [Confirming Kirchoff's Current Law](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18CnDWpo-05z72rtvTztYuwp9SvlM_N1OlUIsGH7a-7c/edit#)

- Collect a Kirchoff's Current Law sheet from the front.
- In a small group set up a station with a hardmat to protect the bench.
- Follow the instructions to set up each circuit in turn, take the required measurements and answer Task 1-4.

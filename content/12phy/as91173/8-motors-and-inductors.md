## Mahi Tuatahi

1. Define a magnetic field
2. What is the symbol and unit for magnetic field?
3. What formula is used to calculate the size of the force experienced by a particle in a magnetic field?
4. How can you determine the direction of the force? Draw and explain an example in your book

---

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F &= BIL
\end{aligned}
$$

Force on a current carrying wire in a magnetic field is given by this equation.

5. Write what each letter stands for and its unit

---

6. What direction is the force on this current carrying wire?
7. What is the force if the field is $0.02T$, the current $2A$ and the length of wire $10cm$?

## Wires on an Angle

What do you think happens to the force if the wire is on an angle?

![](../assets/10-angle-current-wire.png)

---

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F &= BILsin(\theta)
\end{aligned}
$$

- $\theta$ is the angle between the current and the magnetic field
- <mark>Force is maximum when perpendicular to the magnetic field ($sin(90) = 1$)</mark>
- <mark>Force is zero when parallel to the magnetic field ($sin(0) = 0$)</mark>
- _You are not required to do calculations with this equation, but need to know the previous two points._

## DC Motors

- What does a motor do?
- It takes power and turns it into rotational energy! How?

---

1. Sketch this diagram in your book.
2. Identify the direction of force (if any) on each side of the loop.
3. What kind of motion will these forces cause the loop to have?

Up, down, into the board, out of the board

### Pātai/Question

- Recall $F=Bqv$
- What happens if we take a wire and we move it through a magnetic field?

---

#### Whakatika {.c2}

1. The charged particles (electrons) are now moving through an electric field, and therefore feel a force!
2. The force exerted on the moving electrons by the magnetic field will cause them to accelerate and therefore to move
3. If the circuit is complete: 
    a. Moving electrons is known as a __induced current__!
    b. Moving electrons will cause an unequal distribution (difference in potential), known as __induced voltage__.

### Inductors Summary

> Moving charges through a magnetic field will cause them to feel a force (due to the magnetic field). Thus creating an __induced voltage__.

> In a complete circuit, this is seen as a __induced current__.

---

## Induced Voltage

> Exists in a conductor moving through a magnetic field in a perpendicular direction.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & V=BvL
\end{aligned}
$$

- $V$ is the induced voltage (V, Volts)
- $B$ is the magnetic field strength (T, Tesla)
- $v$ is the velocity of the wire ($ms^{-1}$)
- $L$ is the length of wire in the field ($m$)

---

### Pātai

A metal rod is moved in a magnetic field. The rod is $24cm$ long and moves at $8ms^{-1}$ through a magnetic field with strength $0.7T$.

1. Calculate the __induced voltage__
2. Calculate the __induced current__ and indicate direction

#### Whakatika

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & V = BvL \newline
    & V = 0.7 \times 8 \times 0.24 \newline
    & V = 1.344V
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & V = IR \newline
    & I = \frac{V}{R} \newline
    & I = \frac{1.344}{10} = 0.1344A
\end{aligned}
$$

### Thought Whakamātau {.c2}

- Dragging a piece of wire through a magnetic field creates an __induced voltage__
- If the circuit is complete it creates an __induced current__
- What does a current in a magnetic field experience?
- Yes, a force! $F=BIL$

![](../assets/10-vbil-example.png)

---

__Think, pair, share:__ If we drag the coil to the right, what will we observe?

![](../assets/10-vbil-example.png)

---

- A current will be induced,
- That current will experience a force ($F=BIL$)
- That magnetic force will __oppose__ the externally applied force

![](../assets/10-vbil-example.png)


---

## Lenz's Law

- __The induced current (and magnetic force) always opposes the change/action producing it__
- In our previous tauria/example the induced current causes a force which opposes the externally applied force
- This law is a result of __the conservation of energy__. Work must be done to generate electrical energy.

---

Continuing our tauria from earlier: a metal rod is moved in a magnetic field. The rod is $24cm$ long and moves at $8ms^{-1}$ through a magnetic field with strength $0.7T$. __Calculate the magnitude and direction of the opposing force acting upon the rod__.

## Lenz' Law in Solenoids

- __Recall__: A solenoid is a coil of wire used as an electromagnet.
- __Question__: What happens if we pass a magnet through solenoid?
- __Answer:__ We induce a current in the coil.

---

- __Question__: What does that current do?
- __Answer__: It creates a magnetic field that opposes the original field.

---

## Lenz' Law in Solenoids

A magnet moving inside a solenoid will induce a current and therefore, a magnetic field, which will oppose the original field. We can use our right hand rule to deduce the direction of the current flow.

### Understanding Check 1

A magnet is dropped into a long copper tube with its North pole facing downwards. As the North pole approaches the top end of the tube, which way will the current flow, when viewed from above the top of the tube?

---

The current will flow anti-clockwise, creating a magnetic field pointing upwards, opposing the North pole falling down.

---

### Understanding Check 2

When the magnet has just left the bottom of the tube, in which sense does the current flow, again when viewed from above the top of the tube?

---

The current will be in the opposite sense now, i.e. clockwise. When the South pole leaves, Lenz's Law says that there must be a South pole induced at the bottom end of the tube, producing a force on the magnet in the upward direction, opposing its downwards motion.

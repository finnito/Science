## Kirchoff's Laws: Voltage {.c2}

<div>

> The sum of the potential differences (voltages) in any closed loop is zero.<br/>
> OR: That is to say, over a loop, the full voltage (energy) of the power supply must be consumed.

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_{1} + V_{2} + V_{3} &= 0 \newline
V_{1} + V_{4} &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

### PƒÅtai: Harder

Calculate all unknown values.<br/>__Strategy:__ You should start by calculating the total resistance and total current. Then, calculate the voltage used by the resistor in series with the power supply.

## [Confirming Kirchoff's Voltage Law](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18CnDWpo-05z72rtvTztYuwp9SvlM_N1OlUIsGH7a-7c/edit#)

- Collect a Kirchoff's Voltage Law sheet from the front.
- In a small group set up a station with a hardmat to protect the bench.
- Follow the instructions to set up each circuit in turn, take the required measurements and answer Task 1-4.

2. When the cell is switched on, the resistance of the lamp is $9\Omega$. Calculate the current flowing through the lamp. __(A)__
3. State the meaning of the term __resistance__ in terms of electron flow. __(A)__

# Magnetic Fields

Magnetic fields can be found in two places:

- Around magnetic objects
- Around current carrying wires

## Right Hand Grip Rule 1

- Used to find the direction of the current or magnetic field when you know the other.
- This version of the right hand grip rule only applies to current carrying wires!

---

### Ferromagnetism

- Includes Co, Fe and Ni
- Permanent magnets
- Were exposed to a strong external magnetic field and retained the field after being removed from it

---

### Paramagnetism

- Includes Na, Mg, Ca etc.
- Can form a weak internal magnetic field when exposed to an external magnetic field
- Feel a small attractive force

---

### Diamagnetism

- Includes Cu, Si, N, C etc.
- Can form a weak internal magnetic field when exposed to an external magnetic field
- Feel a small repulsive force

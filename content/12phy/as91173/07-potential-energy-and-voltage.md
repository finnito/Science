### Whakatika

1. An area of influence in where a charged object will feel a force

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E &= \frac{F}{q} \newline
    3000 &= \frac{F}{25 \times 10^{-6}} \newline
    F &= 3000 \times 25 \times 10^{-6} \newline
    F &= 0.075N
\end{aligned}

## Electric Potential Energy

Electric potential energy is similar to gravitational potential energy. Moving a charged particle against the direction of the field is similar to lifting an object up in a gravitational potential field.

Therefore, different points in an electric field will have different _potential energies_

### Voltage

> The difference in electric potential energy between two points

$$
\begin{aligned}
    V &= \frac{E_{p}}{q} \newline
    \text{Field Voltage} &= \frac{\text{Potential Energy}}{\text{Charge}}
\end{aligned}

### Mahi Tuatahi Continued

An object with charge $25 \times 10^{-6}C$ is placed in an electric field with strength $3000NC^{-1}$.

3. In the object moves __against__ the field by $2m$, does it gain or lose electric potential energy? And how much?

---

#### Whakatika

Because it moves against the field, it gains electric potential energy.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & E_{p} = Eqd \newline
    & E_{p} = 3000 \times 25 \times 10^{-6} \times 2 \newline
    & E_{p} = 0.15J
\end{aligned}

### Whakatika

Hamish connects a circuit comprised of a 6.0 V battery, 1.0 m of Nichrome resistance wire and two connecting wires. The battery produces a uniform electric field in the Nichrome resistance wire. _Assume that the connecting wires have no resistance._

__(a) Calculate the strength of the electric field in the Nichrome resistance wire. (A)__

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & V=6V, d=1m && \text{(K)} \newline
    & E=? && \text{(U)} \newline
    & E = \frac{V}{d} && \text{(F)} \newline
    & E = \frac{6}{1} = 6Vm^{-1} && \text{(S+S)} 
\end{aligned}
$$

---

__(b) Explain what happens to the size of the electric force on an electron as it travels through the Nichrome resistance wire. (M)__

Throughout the wire the field strength is constant, and the charge on the electron is also constant. Therefore using $F=Eq$ we can see that the force is also constant.

---

__(c) Calculate the distance moved by an electron as it loses 9.6 × 10-20 J of electrical potential energy. (M)__

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & W = 9.6\times10^{-20}J, E = 6Vm^{-1}, q=-1.6\times10^{-19}&& \text{(K)} \newline
    & d = ? && \text{(U)} \newline
    & W = Fd = Eqd && \text{(F)} \newline
    & 9.6\times10^{-20} = 6 \times (-1.6\times10^{-19}) \times d && \text{(S+S)} \newline
    & d = \frac{9.6\times10^{-20}}{6 \times (-1.6\times10^{-19})} = 0.1m
\end{aligned}
$$

---

__(d) Hamish then adds another 6.0 V battery in series AND shortens the wire to 0.50 m. Write a comprehensive explanation on what will happen to the size of the force on the electron. (E) Calculations are not needed.__

- Adding another $6V$ battery will double the electric field strength according to $E = {V}{d}$.
- Shortening the wire from $1m$ to $0.5m$ will also double the field strength according to $E = {V}{d}$.
- Both of these factors will result in a 4x stronger electric field.
- Assuming the charge of the electron stays constant, according to $F=Eq$, the force experienced will also be 4x stronger.

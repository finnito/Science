#### Whakatika

1. __Why is the flame yellow when the air hole is closed?__<br>
Closing the hole limits the oxygen available, this makes the flame orange (cooler).
2. __Why does the flame get hotter and change colour when the hole is gradually opened?__<br>
Opening the hole allows more oxygen to mix with the gas. This allows it to burn hotter (blue).

3. __What flame should be used when the Bunsen burner is not in use (orange or blue)?__<br>
Orange.
4. __Why should that flame be used?__<br>
It is more visible and not as hot. You are less likely to burn yourself, and any burns will be less severe!

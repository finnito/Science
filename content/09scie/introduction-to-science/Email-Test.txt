Re : <First Name> <Last Name> (<Class>, Science)

<First Name> has been working hard for the last few weeks on our Introduction to Science/PÅ«taiao topic. At the end of this week <First Name> will have their first test for the year. This is both a chance for <First Name> to show themselves that they are capable, and also for me to see how they are going with the content so far.

The learning outcomes and notes for the whole year are stored on my own website (https://putaiao.nz/09scie/introduction-to-science/). I have also linked these on Google Classroom.

Specifically, I have made a page with some guidelines for revision this week. I have posted the specific link on Google Classroom, also.

They will also be given a the three page revision worksheet for them to do in their own time.

Thank you for your support of <First Name> so far this year!
 
Kia angitu (be successful)!

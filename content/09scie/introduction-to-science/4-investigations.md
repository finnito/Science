## <mark>The Aim</mark> / Whāinga Whānui

> What is <mark>the objective</mark> of your experiment?

An aim describes what you will be investigating (the purpose of the experiment). Keep it simple, one sentence long.

> e.g. The aim of this experiment is to investigate the relationship between the colour of the Bunsen flame and how fast the water heats up.

---

## <mark>The Hypothesis</mark> / Whakapae

> <mark>A prediction</mark> for the outcome of the experiment.

A hypothesis should make a __specific__ and __testable__ prediction about the outcome of your experiment. It must make a prediction about the effect of your _independent variable_ on your _dependent variable_.

> e.g. I think that an orange flame will heat the water to 100C more quickly than the blue flame.

## <mark>Independent Variable</mark> / Taurangi Rāwekeweke

> The <mark>variable that you will change</mark> throughout the experiment.

Be specific about what _exactly_ you are changing. Where possible, you should include units of measurement.

> e.g. We will change the mass of the projectile (measured in kgs). We will use 0.25kg, 0.5kg, 0.75kg, 1kg and 2kg masses.

---

## <mark>Dependent Variable</mark> / Taurangi Whakamauru

> <mark>The variable being measured.</mark>

Be specific about what you will measure and the units of measurement of the dependent variable.

> e.g. We will measure the time taken to produce $10ml$ of carbon dioxide gas.

---

## <mark>Control Variables</mark> / Ngā Taurangi Whakatina

> Things that you are <mark>keeping __constant__</mark> in between trials.

Include __at least three control variables__ for your experiments and explain how they keep the experiment fair.

---

### <mark>Fair Testing</mark> / Whakamātau Tika

<mark>You must have control variables to have a fair test.</mark>

Without control variables you cannot be sure if your independent variable (flame colour) was the thing affecting the time taken to heat the water.

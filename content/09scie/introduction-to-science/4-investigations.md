## The Aim / Whāinga Whānui

> What is the objective of your experiment?

An aim describes what you will be investigating (the purpose of the experiment). Keep it simple, one sentence long.

> e.g. The aim of this experiment is to investigate the relationship between the colour of the Bunsen flame and how fast the water heats up.

---

## The Hypothesis / Whakapae

> A prediction for the outcome of the experiment.

A hypothesis should make a __specific__ and __testable__ prediction about the outcome of your experiment. It must make a prediction about the effect of your _independent variable_ on your _dependent variable_.

> e.g. I think that an orange flame will heat the water to 100C more quickly than the blue flame.

## Independent Variable / Taurangi Rāwekeweke

> The variable that you will change throughout the experiment.

Be specific about what _exactly_ you are changing. Where possible, you should include units of measurement.

> e.g. We will change the mass of the projectile (measured in kgs). We will use 0.25kg, 0.5kg, 0.75kg, 1kg and 2kg masses.

---

## Dependent Variable / Taurangi Whakamauru

> The variable(s) being measured.

Be specific about what you will measure and the units of measurement of the dependent variable.

> e.g. We will measure the time taken to produce $10ml$ of carbon dioxide gas.

## Control Variables / Ngā Taurangi Whakatina

> Things that you are keeping __constant__ in between trials.

Include __at least three control variables__ for your experiments and explain how they keep the experiment fair.

---

### Fair Testing / Whakamātau Tika

Control variables are extremely important because they are what keep a trial fair and let you __draw a causal relationship between your independent and dependent variable__.

Without control variables you cannot say for sure what the influence of your independent variable was.

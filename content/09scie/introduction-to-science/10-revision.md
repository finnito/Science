## 1. Ensure your notes are complete

- Go through the slides for:
	+ Lab Safety
	+ Bunsen Burner
	+ Investigations
	+ Graphing
- Read them thoroughly and add any missing notes to your exercise book
- __Do not re-write your notes__ - this practice is time consuming and not very beneficial.

---

## 2. Read through your notes

- After your notes are complete, read through them slowly.
- If you don't understand what something means, take a bright coloured pen and indicate this next to the note.
- At the end, seek clarification from your teacher or the internet about the points you highlighted.

## 3. Create a single sided A4 summary notes sheet {.c2}

- Can be a mind-map, or more _organised_ boxes
- Include diagrams
- Fit it all onto one page

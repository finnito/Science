## Recall: Respiration

> The chemical process through which animal cells create energy.

Note: animals must eat other things to get sugar (glucose) for respiration.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	sugar + oxygen &\rightarrow \text{carbon dioxide} + water \newline
	C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2} &\rightarrow 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O
\end{aligned}
$$

## Photosynthesis & Producers

Producer: An organism that makes its own energy (does not need to consume others).

> Photosynthesis: The process of turning carbon dioxide and water into sugar.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\text{carbon dioxide} + water &\xrightarrow{light} oxygen + sugar \newline
	6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O &\xrightarrow{light} 6O_{2} + C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}
\end{aligned}
$$

It's the opposite of respiration! We need plants and plants need us.

### PƒÅtai {.c2}

1. This graph shows plant growth throughout the year. What hemisphere is this plant growing in? How do you know that?
2. Why does the plant not grow much during the winter months?
3. What is happening in May/June to cause the growth rate to increase?

1. It is growing in the Northern Hemisphere, we know this because it grows the most during June/July which is their midsummer.
2. It does not grow much during winter because there is less sun AND because it has shed it's leaves (it is deciduous NOT evergreen).
3. It is growing more leaves so that it can do more photosynthesis and grow taller.

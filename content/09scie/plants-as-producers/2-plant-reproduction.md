## Reproductive Cycle

You have been given a timeline of plat reproduction, but it is out of order.

1. Put a heading "__Plant Reproduction__" in your book
2. Cut up the timeline
3. Work with the person next to you to put them into order
4. Be ready to check and then glue them into your book

### Whakatika

1. Plants produce pollen
2. This pollen can be carried away from the plant by animals, wind or rain
3. Once on a different plant, this pollen can fertilise the flower by landing on its stigma
4. The pollen may _germinate_ (grow down into) the ovule of the plant
5. This can result in the growth of seeds or fruit

---

### Self and Cross-Pollinating

- __Self-Pollinating__: The plant can fertilise itself
- __Cross-Pollinating__: The plant needs to get pollen from another flower of the same species

---

### Task

Yesterday during the dissection you drew a diagram of a flower in your book and labelled the parts.

If you were away or your drawing was incomplete, collect and glue in a diagram.

## The "Male" Parts {.c2}

![](../assets/flower-diagram.png)

- __Stamen__: The appendage containing anther and filament
- __Anther__: The top of the stamen where the pollen is stored "male" reproductive parts
- __Filament__: Supports the anther

---

## The "Female" Parts {.c2}

![](../assets/flower-diagram.png)

- __Stigma__: Receives (captures) pollen to be used in reproduction
- __Style__: A hollow tube through which pollen can grow to reach the ovary
- __Ovary__: Contains the ovules (eggs; female reproductive parts). It becomes fruit.
- __Ovules__: Become seeds to grow new plants.

## Other Parts {.c2}

- __Petal__: The aesthetic part of a flower; attracts pollinators
- __Sepal__: Protects the flower when not in bloom; supports the petals when in bloom

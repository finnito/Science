## Types of Energy {.c2}

<div>
For each of these types of energy, think of and write down one tauria/example:

1. Heat
2. Magnetic
3. Radiant
4. Sound
5. Nuclear
</div>
<div>
6. Gravitational
7. Kinetic
8. Chemical
9. Elastic
10. Electrical

## Active vs. Potential Energy {.c2}

We split these 10 types of energy into two broad categories.

---

### Active Energy

> Energy that is __doing work__ (something that can be observed and measured).

---

### Potential Energy

> Energy that is __stored__ some way, and can be released to do something active!

---

### Active Energy Tauria {.c2}

Kinetic, sound, radiant, heat and electrical

---

### Potential Energy Tauria {.c2}

Gravitational, nuclear, chemical, elastic and magnetic

## Mahi Tuatahi

Match these types of energy and their definitions up in your book:

|               |            |                                |                                 |
|:--------------|:-----------|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
| Thermal       | Light      | Light Bulbs, a Bunsen flame    | talking, TV, radio              |
| Gravitational | Kinetic    | hot water, a hot radiator      | Nuclear bombs, power stations   |
| Nuclear       | Sound      | Anything that is moving        | Food, batteries, burning things |
| Elastic       | Electrical | book on a shelf, bungee jumper | a wind-up-toy, rubber band      |
| Computer      | Chemical   |                                |                                 |

### Energy Circus

Move around the room and see how each toy works.
__Write down the types of energy involved in each object!__

---

## Conservation of Energy

The __Law of Energy Conservation__ is true throughout the universe. We have never found a situation where it doesn't apply!

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Energy in} &= \text{Energy out}
\end{aligned}
$$

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one type to another.

### Whakamātau Whakaaro / Thought Experiment

Consider a skydiver falling to Earth.

1. What kind of energy do they have before they jump out of the plane? Active or potential?
2. What about after they start falling?

<p class="instruction">Discuss with the person and then write your answers in your book.</p>

---

#### Whakatika {.c2}

1. When they are about to jump out of the plane <mark>they have gravitational potential energy</mark>.
2. When they are falling they have <mark>both gravitational potential and kinetic energy</mark>.

### Tauria

- Chemical energy in food is transformed to heat energy and kinetic energy by our bodies
- Gravitational energy in a ball is converted to kinetic energy when it falls to the ground

---

What energy transformations are happening at the boxes?

![](../assets/types_of_energy-conversions.png)

---

1. Chemical potential energy in the battery is transformed into electrical energy moving along the earphones wire
2. Electrical energy in the wire causes the earphone unit to move transforming it into sound energy

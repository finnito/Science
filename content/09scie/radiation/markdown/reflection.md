### Whakatika Tahi

Because they do not absorb much light, instead they reflect almost all of it away!

---

## Reflection/_Whakaata_ {.c2}

- Everything we see reflects light!
- Coloured objects reflect mostly that colour light
- Mirrors reflect all colours of light

### Pātai Rua: Why do some reflections form images?

---

### Whakatika Rua

- Smooth surfaces reflect light __regularly__
- This means the light rays are reflected in the same "order", forming an image

## Tūhura: Reflection/Whakaata

- In your groups of 3:
    - Use a ray box to shine an incident ray at the mirror
    - Sketch what is ocurring on the paper
    - Measure the angles of reflection that matches each angle of incidence

---

## The Law of Reflection

> The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence 

> He ōrite te koki whakaata ki te koki whakapā o te aho

### Uses of Reflection {.c2}

- A fibre optic cable works by reflection. 
- Light rays travel down the cable and reflect off the inside walls of the cable even when it is bent.

- Endoscopes use optical fibres. 
- A doctor can insert a bundle of optical fibres into the body to see the inside of the body clearly – and help them diagnose diseases or see what they are doing during keyhole surgery.

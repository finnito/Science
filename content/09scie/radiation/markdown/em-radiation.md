## Akoranga 1 Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. I can name the main source of radiation and describe how it transfers energy

---

## What is Electromagnetic (EM) Radiation?

- A type of __radiant energy__ which can move through a vacuum.
- Comes in many forms like visible light and heat energy

## Akoranga 2 Mahi Tuatahi

1.  Draw below, a diagram of what your magnifying glass looked like while you were trying to ignite your piece of paper. Indicate areas of relative brightness/darkness.
2.  Try and explain what is happening to the light to cause your diagram above.
3.  Why does the paper catch fire?
4.  Do any particular colours catch fire better than others?

## Electromagnetic (EM) Radiation / _Hihi Autōhiko_ {.c2}

- A type of __radiant energy__ which can move through a vacuum (_korekore_).
- Comes in many forms like visible light and heat energy
- Is a big spectrum (_tūāwhiorangi_)!

## Visible Light / _Aho Kitea_ {.c2}

- Visible light is only a very small part of the spectrum
- Is between $380$ to $700 nanometers$
- Purple/violet has the most energy (shortest wavelength)
- Red has the least energy (longest wavelength)

## Visible light/_Aho Kitea_

> Light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum which can be seen by the human eye.

> Ko te whānuitanga o ngā ngaru autōhiko. I tētahi pito ko ngā ngaru roa he pōturi te auautanga (ngaru reo irirangi), i tētahi pito ko ngā ngaru poto he tere te auautanga (ngaru kama). Ko te aho e kitea ana e te karu tangata, tētahi wāhanga o te tūāwhiorangi autōhiko.

## Luminous Objects

- Luminous objects are objects that give off their own visible light, they are sources of visible light.
- Light waves travel very fast and in a straight line from the source of the light, at a speed of 300,000 kilometres per second (300,000 km/s). 
- __Task__: Name as many luminous objects as you can think of.

## What are Colours?{.c2}

- Colours are different wavelengths/_roa o te ngaru_ of visible light
- White light is made up of all the different colours/wavelengths/_roa o te ngaru_!

## Whakakite: Prisms/_Ngā Poro_

- When white light passes through a prism/_poro_, the different wavelengths are bent at different angles
- This causes them to separate, and all the different colours to become visible

---

## Whakakite: Newton's Wheel

- We can combine the colours of the spectrum to create white light!

## What about Colour Blindness? {.c2}

- When your eyes cannot distinguish between different colours
- Genetic condition, inherited from your parents!

Re: <First> (9TLN, Science)

<First> has been working hard for the last few weeks on our Radiation and the Human Body (light & the eye) topic. On Friday <Name> will be having an assessment for this topic. <He> received four task sheets today in class which <he> can work on at home as revision. If <he> can do these, <he> can do the test.

The learning outcomes and notes for the whole year are stored on my own website (https://putaiao.nz/09scie/radiation/). I have also linked these on Google Classroom.

Thank you for your support of <First> throughout the year!
 
Kia angitu (be successful)!

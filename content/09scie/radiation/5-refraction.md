## Refraction

The bending of light when it changes speed as it enters a new medium.

__Medium__: Any type of matter that radiation can travel through. E.g. air, water, glass.

---

## Law of Refraction {.c2}

> When light travels into a more dense medium it _slows down_ and bends towards the normal. When it moves into a less dense medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.
>  
> The normal is a 90 degree angle to the surface.

### Cloze {.c2}

<div>
Copy this diagram and paragraph into your book. Fill in these missplaced words: <mark>speeds up, eye, Sun, less, reflects, away</mark>.

As the fish ________ light from the ______, some rays will enter your ___ and you will therefore see a fish. When the light leaves the water, it enters air which is a _____ dense medium. The light therefore __________ and bends ________ from the normal. This means that the fish _appears_ to be higher in the water than it actually is, and the fisherperson may miss.

## Refraction and Colour {.c2}

- Not all light refracts equally. Some do it better than others!
- <mark>Red light refracts the worst, while purple refracts the best</mark>
- Using this principle, light that appears "white" which comes from the Sun, can be split up into a rainbow!
- This is how rainbows work with rain droplets

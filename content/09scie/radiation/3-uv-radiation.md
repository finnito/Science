## Ozone Layer

- __Pātai__: Why is there a hole?
- __Whakatika__: We used to use chemicals called _chloroflurocarbons (CFCs)_ in aerosol cans. These chemicals break down the ozone layer!
- The ozone layer very slowly naturally repairs itself, so since we stopped using them, it is slowly getting better!

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. I can name the main source of radiation and describe how it transfers energy

---

## Electromagnetic (EM) Radiation?

- A type of <mark>__radiant energy__</mark> which can move through the vacuum of space
- Comes in many forms like visible light and heat energy
- Travels fast enough to go around Earth 8 times a second (300,000km per hour)
- The <mark>main source is the Sun!</mark>

|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |

---

### Refraction {.c2}

When light goes from one material to another e.g. from air to water, it can bend and change direction.

---

### Absorption {.c2}

E.g. an apple absorbs all colours of light __except__ red, which is reflected into your eyes!

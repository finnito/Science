## Learning Outcomes

1. __What is Radiation?__
    - I can name the main source of radiation and describe how it transfers energy
    - I can recall the order and use of each type of electromagnetic radiation
    - I can name the seven colours of the visible spectrum and describe how to produce a spectrum by dispersion
2. __Why are some types of radiation dangerous?__
    - I can name some types of ionizing radiation
    - I can explain why UV radiation is linked to skin cancer and why rates are relatively higher in NZ than in other countries
    - I can describe strategies to reduce the risk of developing melanoma
    - I can explain a technological use of UV light
3. __How can we see objects?__
    - I can state the difference between a luminous and non-luminous object
    - I can annotate a diagram to show how rays of light enter our eyes
    - I can describe a regular reflection and give some examples of its use
    - I can label the main structures of the eye and explain how the structure enables us to see
4. __How can light play tricks on us?__
    - I can explain why refraction is
    - I have made observations on the behaviour of light rays when they move from air to glass
    - I can explain why a coin will disappear in a cup when we pour water into it
5. __Applications__
    - I can apply knowledge about radiation to new situations

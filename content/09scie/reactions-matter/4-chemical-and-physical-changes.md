## Chemical Changes

Yesterday in our experiment we observed many reactions! Some reactions did chemical changes:

1. Change in colour
2. Bubbles produced
3. Solid dissolved
4. Solid produced

## Physical Changes

Physical change is when the <mark>atoms/molecules are not changed inside matter. Nothing new is produced</mark>.

1. Change in texture
2. Change in shape

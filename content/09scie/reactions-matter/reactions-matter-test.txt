Re: <First> (<Class>, Science)

<First Name> has been working hard for the last few weeks on our Reactions Matter (Chemistry) topic. Next Tuesday (10/05/22) we will have the end of topic test for this unit.

The learning outcomes and notes for the whole year are stored on my own website (https://putaiao.nz/09scie/reactions-matter/). I have also linked these on Google Classroom.

<First> can also find posts on Google Classroom for each week of the unit outlining what we covered with links to notes and activities where possible.

<First> has been issued with a three-page revision booklet. By working through this booklet <First> can be fairly confident in their knowledge.

Thank you for your support of <First Name> so far this year!
 
Kia angitu (be successful)!

## Solid, Liquid and Gas {.c2}

There are three states of matter. <mark>Glue in your diagram</mark> that shows how to move from each state to state.

### The Particles

In each state of matter the particles are arranged differently because they have different amounts of energy. __Energy means temperature__.

### Solid {.c2}

- The atoms are neatly arranged,
- are tightly packed,
- can vibrate but not move freely,
- and have the lowest energy (coldest).

### Liquid {.c2}

- The atoms are close together,
- do not have a particlar arrangement,
- can move past and around each other,
- move to fit the shape of the vessel,
- and have a medium energy.

### Gas {.c2}

- The atoms are free-moving,
- do not have a particular arrangement,
- move and collide with each other,
- fill the volume of a vessel,
- and have a high energy (hot).

### In Summary!

- A high energy $\rightarrow$ high speed $\rightarrow$ gas
- A low energy $\rightarrow$ low speed $\rightarrow$ liquid
- Very low energy $\rightarrow$ no speed, vibration only $\rightarrow$ solid

## It's All About Energy

- Atoms in liquids have more energy than those in solids.
	+ Therefore, to turn a solid into a liquid you must __add__ energy (heat)!
- Atoms in gasses have more energy than those in liquids.
	+ Therefore, to turn a liquid into a gas you must __add__ energy (heat)!
- Atoms in solids have less energy than those in liquids.
	+ Therefore, to turn a liquid into a solid you must __remove__ energy (heat)!

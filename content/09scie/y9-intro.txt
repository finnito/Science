Tēnā koe,

My name is Finn Le Sueur and I will be <First Name>'s teacher for Year 9 Pūtaiao this year. Attached to this email is a letter with a large amount of information about Year 9 and the opportunities that <First Name> has available to them.

The letter should answer many of your questions, but please do not hesitate to be in contact if you have any concerns throughout the year.

Thank you for your support of <First Name>!

Mā te wā,
Finn Le Sueur

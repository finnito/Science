## Phases of the Moon {.c2}

- Write the title above and glue in your diagram.
- As the moon orbits Earth, different sides of it are exposed to sunlight throughout the month.
- From our view on Earth, this causes different amounts of the moon in view to be lit up.

## Facts {.c2}

- The moon is tidally locked with Earth, this means we see the same side of the moon all the time!
- There is no "dark side of the moon". All sides at lit at different times of the month.
- A waxing moon is one that is growing in size

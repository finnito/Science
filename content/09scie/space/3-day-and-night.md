## Ohia Manomano/ Brainstorm: Day / Night

---

## Ng훮 Wh훮inga Ako

1. Describe how day and night are caused by rotation

---

## The Colours of Earth {.c2}

![](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000478532243.jpg "")

- Blue is caused by light __reflecting__ off the oceans
- Green/brown by light __reflecting__ off the continents
- White by light __reflecting__ off the clouds and snow at the poles

## Day and Night {.c2}

Glue in your diagram! to the middle of a landscape page with room for taking notes around the outside!

### Luminous {.c2}

- What does reflecting mean?
- Reflecting: redirecting light __not__ creating it
- <mark>Earth, the moon, and planets do not create their own light. They are non-luminous.</mark>
- <mark>Only the sun creates its own light. It is luminous.</mark>

---

### Light and Dark {.c2}

- The Sun is essentially stationary while Earth rotates
- <mark>The side facing the Sun is day</mark>
- <mark>The side facing away is night</mark>

### Earth's Rotation {.c2}

- <mark>It takes 24 hours for Earth to rotate once on its axis!</mark>
- The rotation causes different parts of Earth to face the sun at different times of the day.
- <mark>The sun is "stationary". When you face the sun it is daytime, and when you face away, it is nighttime</mark>.

### Direction of Rotation {.c2}

- <mark>The Earth rotates from west to east (anticlockwise from the north pole).</mark>
- This makes the Sun appear to rise in the East (Sumner Beach).
- And appear to set in the West (Southern Alps).
- <mark>In reality, the Sun is not moving, it is Earth that is rotating.</mark>

### Axial Tilt {.c2}

- <mark>Earth's axis is tilted by 23째</mark>
- This is important for the seasons which we will learn about later!

## P훮tai: Discuss with the person next to you!

1. Why is the day/night cycle not caused by Earth orbiting around the Sun?
2. What is defined by Earth orbiting around the Sun?

---

## Earth's Orbit {.c2}

![](http://bestanimations.com/Earth&Space/earth-sun-orbit-animation.gif "")

- <mark>__Orbit__: The path Earth takes around the Sun</mark>
- <mark>Earth orbits the sun every 365.256 days</mark>
- Thus, every four years (approximately) we need to add a day - a leap day!

---

## Ellipses {.c2}

- Earth's orbit is an ellipse - an oval instead of a perfect circle
- __Aphelion__: Furthest point the Sun (152,100,000km)
- __Perihelion__: Closest point to the sun (147,300,000km)

Re: <First> (9TLN, Science/PÅ«taiao)

<First> has been working hard for the last few weeks on the Space topic. This Friday (26/08/2022) <he> will have the end of topic test for the unit.

All activities, notes and learning outcomes can be found on Google Classroom (some of which link to my own website https://putaiao.nz/09scie/space/).

To revise for this unit <First> has a number of things <he> can work on:
1. Review Google Classroom to see what activities <he> may have missed
2. Review the notes to see what content <he> may have missed
3. Complete the two Education Perfect tasks
4. Complete the two revision sheets being handed out this week (also linked on Classroom)
5. Complete any missed questions from their Reading Tables activity (also linked on Classroom)

Thank you for your ongoing support of <First>!
 
Kia angitu (be successful)!

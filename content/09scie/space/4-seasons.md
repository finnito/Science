1. Explain how the seasons are produced by an orbit

## The Seasons {.c2}

- __MISCONCEPTION__: They __are not__ caused by our distance from the sun changing
- They __are__ caused by Earth's axial tilt of 23.5 degrees!

### Reason 1: Sunlight Hours

- <mark>Summer:</mark> the Southern Hemisphere (SH) is tilted towards the Sun, so we get <mark>more warming hours (sunlight) than cooling hours (nighttime)</mark>. Therefore it is warm.
- <mark>Winter:</mark> the SH is tilted away, so we get <mark>fewer warming hours than cooling hours</mark>, and therefore it is cold.
- Places near the equator get a steady number of warming and cooling hours all year, so have consistent temperatures=!

### Reason 2: Solar Flux {.c2}

![](https://magazine.scienceconnected.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/seasons-solstice-diagram-e1481496428917.png)

- When the SH is tilted towards the Sun, it is higher in the sky. This means the sunlight is more direct and transfers __more energy per square meter__.
- When the SH is tilted away, the Sun is lower in the sky and tranfers __less energy per square meter__.

---

### Special Places {.c2}

- The sun does not rise for ~2.5 months at the North and South poles during their winters.
- The equator always sees relatively direct sunlight (high in the sky) and so is always warm!

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. Explain how the seasons are produced by an orbit
2. Explain how the Moon has phases and creates tides

## The Seasons {.c2}

- __MISCONCEPTION__: They are __not__ caused by our distance from the sun changing
- They are caused by Earth's axial tilt of 27.5 degrees!

## Solar Flux {.c2}

- Summer occurs when the sunlight is most direct (higher in the sky, more sun hours)
- Winter occurs when sunlight is the least direct (lower in the sky, fewer sun hours)
- Because it takes time to heat up, the warmest and coldest days are a month after the solstice

---

## Special Places {.c2}

- The sun does not rise for ~2.5 months at the north and south poles during their winter
- The equator always sees relatively direct sunlight (high in the sky) and so is always warm!

## The Tides {.c2}

- __MISCONCEPTION__: They are not __just__ caused by the moon.
- They are caused by __both__ sun and moon!
- The moon and sun exert a gravitational pull on the Earth and its water

## The Tides {.c2}

- The moon has a stronger pull than the sun because it is closer
- __Spring Tide:__ When moon and sun are in line, the tides are bigger!
- __Neap Tide:__ When moon and sun are perpendicular the tides are smaller

---

## The Tides {.c2}

- The moon orbits Earth every 27 days, therefore the moon and sun align once every ~13/14 days
- Draw this illustration in your book and then come up the front!

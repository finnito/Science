## Contributing & Github Repository

All of my planning is available on this website, and you can even personally contribute edits & additions of content by heading over to the Github repository below, or clicking on "Edit this Page" on any of the pages.

This website is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) from a Github repository which you can visit [over here](https://github.com/finnito/Science).

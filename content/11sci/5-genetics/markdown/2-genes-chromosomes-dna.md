# Learning Outcomes

- Understand the relationship between cells, nuclei, chromosomes, genes, alleles and DNA.
- Understand the role DNA plays in carrying instructions to the next generation and determining phenotype.

---

Think, pair and share what do you know about __DNA__, __genes__, __chromosomes__, __cells__, __nucleus__, __organisms__ and can you put them in order of magnitude?

---

## What are we made of?

Organisms are made of cells, each cell contains a nucleus, the nucleus contains chromosomes made up of DNA, and DNA contains many genes.

### Cells

All organisms on Earth are made of one or more cells

---

### Nucleus

Inside each cell is a nucleus. The nucleus holds genome of the cell in the form of chromosomes.

---

### Chromosomes

Chromosomes are located inside the nucleus and are made up of long chains of DNA.
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, giving us 46 in total!

### Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)

DNA is a very long chain of _base pairs_ which forms chromosomes.

---

### Genes

A gene is a small segment of DNA made of _base pairs_ and are what determine everything about us! Each chromosome carries __many__ genes. Humans have around 25000 genes. That is a lot of genes per chromosome!

---

### Alleles

Each gene has two __alleles__, one __allele__ comes from each parent. E.g. brown hair from mum, blonde from dad.

## Exercise: Building DNA!

sciPAD pages, cut out the DNA pieces and build some DNA and stick it on the previous page!

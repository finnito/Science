## Bacteria Brainstorm

---

### Structure of a Bacterium {.c2}

![](../assets/bacteria-diagram.png)

- Glue the diagram into the centre of a page
- We will make notes around the outside

---

### Movement {.c2}

- Most <mark>movement is achieved using the flagellum</mark> for __swimming__
- Some movement can be achieved using pili (twitching)

---

### Respiration {.c2}

![](../assets/bacteria-diagram.png)

- Bacteria do <mark>__aerobic respiration__ which requires oxygen</mark>
- Occurs in the plasma membrane of the bacteria
- <mark>$C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + O_{2} \rightarrow CO_{2} + H_{2}O + energy$</mark>
- There have been some bacteria that do __anaerobic respiration__ (without oxygen) but this is less common

---

### Sensitivity {.c2}

- As we will show tomorrow, bacteria are sensitive to their environment
- They <mark>can be killed by altering environmental factors</mark> such as: oxygen availability, temperature, water availability, food availability, and chemicals that break down their cellular structure

### Growth {.c2}

![](../assets/bacteria-diagram.png)

- Growth is a way to produce the materials required for reproduction
- For example, bacteria make proteins in small organelles called __ribosomes__ which can be found near the __nucleus__
- Proteins are used for everything from respiration to building the plasma membrane and everything in between

---

### Reproduction {.c2}

- Like _fungi_, bacteria <mark>reproduce through __binary fission__</mark>
- In this process the bacteria <mark>makes a clone</mark> of itself
- Some bacteria undergo a process of __conjugation__ where they swap some genetic material with another through direct physical contact
- Some other bacteria simply scoop up miscellaneous DNA floating around the environment

### Excretion {.c2}

- The processes of excretion is called <mark>__exocytosis__</mark>
- Byproducts of cellular life processes are captured in __vesicles__
- These <mark>vesicles fuse with the __plasma membrane__ before releasing their contents to the outside</mark> of the cell
- __Sketch a quick diagram of this process__

---

### Nutrition {.c2}

- Nutrients are brought into the cell via a process called <mark>__endocytosis__</mark>
- The nutrients are <mark>captured into __vesicles__ and transported around the cell</mark> to the required area
- __Sketch a quick diagram of this process__

### Ngohe / Task

- Use your device to research the purpose of the cellular structures that we did not discuss
	+ Cytoplasm
	+ Cell wall
	+ Cell capsule
	+ Nucleoid
	+ Plasmids

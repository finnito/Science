### Brainstorm: What do you know about microbes?

---

### 3 Important Types

Microorganisms (microbes) are living things that are <mark>too small to see with the naked eye.</mark>

They are sometimes <mark>unicellular (made of one cell), or multicellular (many cells, like you!)</mark>.

1. Bacteria
2. Fungi
3. Viruses

### Pātai: Are they helpful to humans or harmful? {.c2}

- Both!
- They <mark>can cause disease</mark> (looking at you, SARS-CoV-2 virus)
	+ <mark>Disease causing microbes are called __pathogens__</mark>
- They <mark>can be used to make food (yoghurt, ginger beer, mushrooms)</mark>

### Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. Describe the structure of fungi

- Made of clusters of cells (<mark>multicellular</mark>)
- Fungi are sometimes too small to see, but once the group of cells gets too large it becomes visible to the naked eye
- Get their food by <mark>absorbing dissolved organic molecules</mark>

---

#### Function of Fungi

-  Fungi exist in ecosystems to <mark>break down (decay) dead organic matter into small molecules</mark> that are able to be be used by other living things
-  This is <mark>so that energy and nutrients can be reused</mark>!

#### Structure of Fungi

1. Collect a sheet from the front of class
2. Cut it to size and glue it into your book
3. Label the following parts: mycelium, spore, reproductive structure, hyphae

## Viruses Brainstorm

---

### Structure of Viruses {.c2}

![](../assets/virus-diagram.jpg)

- Glue the diagram into the centre of a page
- We will make notes around the outside
- A <mark>bacteriophage is a virus that infects bacteria</mark>, specifically

---

### Movement {.c2}

- Viruses <mark>cannot move of their own free will</mark>
- They <mark>rely on their host to move</mark> them around
- Movement of fluid, air currents, etc.

---

### Respiration {.c2}

![](../assets/virus-diagram.jpg)

- Viruses <mark>do not do aerobic or anaerobic respiration</mark>
- They <mark>do not metabolize food</mark> to release energy

---

### Sensitivity {.c2}

- Viruses are somewhat sensitive to their environment
- Their <mark>replication can be slowed or stopped through controlling temperature, for example</mark>

---

### Growth {.c2}

![](../assets/virus-diagram.jpg)

- Viruses <mark>do not produce their own proteins</mark>
- They rely on a host cell to do that work for them

---

### Reproduction {.c2}

- Viruses <mark>do not perform binary fission or any other type of reproduction</mark>
- They <mark>infect a host cell with their own DNA or RNA</mark>
- This <mark>genetic material hijacks the cell, causing it to build more viruses</mark>
- The <mark>host cell then dies</mark>

---

### Excretion {.c2}

![](../assets/virus-diagram.jpg)

- Viruses <mark>do not perform excretion</mark>, as they do not do respiration
- Therefore, they do not have any byproducts to excrete

---

### Nutrition {.c2}

- Viruses <mark>do not do nutrition</mark>, because they have no need for food
- They do not need food <mark>because they do not do respiration (for growth and reproduction)</mark>

### Ngohe / Task

- Use your device to research the purpose of the cellular structures that we did not discuss:
	+ Protein coat
	+ Tail
	+ Fibres
	+ Membrane envelope

The video before shows us a few very important things:

1. Ionic bonding
2. Word formulas
3. Symbol formulas
4. __Precipitation reaction__

---

## Precipitation Reaction

- A precipitation reaction is where two reactants _swap partners_ and a solid is formed.
- You will need to use your solubility rules on your sheet to predict the solid.
- All other products/reactants are aqueous (aq).
- $AB + CD \longrightarrow AC + BD$

### Doing A Precipitation Reaction

1. __Achieved__: A word equation
2. __Merit__: A balanced symbol equation
3. __Excellence__: Predicting the precipitate (solubility rules)

---

### Practice

Write a word equation, symbol equation and predict the precipitate for this reaction.

## Starter

1. Write down the __general reaction__ for a displacement reaction
2. What might you observe if a displacement reaction has occurred?
3. How do you know/how can you predict if a displacement reaction will occur?
4. A piece of lead is placed into a silver iodide solution. Will a reaction occur?
    - If it will, write a word and symbol equation for it.
5. A piece of aluminium is placed into a magnesium sulfate solution. Will a reaction occur?
    - If it will, write a word and symbol equation for it.

## Decomposition Reactions

\begin{align*}
    AB \longrightarrow A + B
\end{align*}


A reaction where two ions are combined to form a compound. It is the reverse of __combination__ and a lot of energy is required for the reaction to occur.

### Example

Mercury (II) oxide is heated in a test tube. The solid is seen to change colour and a gas is given off.

1. If the gas is oxygen, how could you confirm this?
2. Write a word equation.
3. Write a symbol equation (with states) and balance it.

---

1. A glowing splint in the presence of oxygen gas, will reignite.
2. mercury oxide $\xrightarrow{\text{heat}}$ mercury + oxygen gas
2. $2HgO_{s} \xrightarrow{\text{heat}} 2Hg_{l} + O_{2g}$

## Assessment Tips

1. Collect a paper from the front of the classroom
2. Name it
3. Quietly read through it while everyone else arrives

### How the Assessment Works

| Day 1                 | Day 2                 | Day 3                      |
|:----------------------|:----------------------|:---------------------------|
| Write predictions     | Continue experiments  | Finish experiments         |
| Write word equations  |                       | Complete write-up          |
| Start experiments     |                       | Do excellence comparisons  |

### Achieved

For 2 out of the 6 reactions:

- Collecting information (observations) about a range of chemical reactions.
- Writing word equations to describe the chemical reactions.
- Classifying the chemical reactions.

---

### Merit

- __Achieved + the following for 2 out of 6 reactions__
- Explaining the classification of the chemical reactions.
- Completing symbol equations for the chemical reactions.

---

### Excellence

- __Merit + the following for 2 out of the 6 reactions__
- In depth discussion (may include justifying, elaborating, relating, analysing, links between the classification of the reactions, observations and equations).
- Completing balanced symbol equations for the chemical reactions.

---

## Making Observations

- Colour changes
- Gases given off
- Changes of states

---

## Justifying Your Prediction

- Relate your observations to the number of reactants
- Relate your observations to the number of products
- Relate the number of reactants/products to general reaction equations

### Lesson Plans

1. Review of the Atom
     - Intro to the unit
     - Review of the atom notes/worksheet + slides for backup
2. Periodic Table & Electrons
     - Worksheet
3. Ionic Compounds
     - Starter: Form into table groups and find out the name of each ion in a column and compile them on the board (project the table)
     - Copy other groups names onto your own table
     - Notes on atoms vs ions using diagrams and electron shell configurations
     - Notes on creating ionic compounds
     - Use whiteboards in table groups to make compounds as a quiz/speed game
4. Ionic Compounds
    - Finish quiz/speed game
    - Ionic compounds Quizlet
    - Video on ionic compounds
    - Writing formulae worksheet

     - Intro to the unit
     - Review of the atom notes/worksheet + slides for backup
2. Periodic Table & Electrons
     - Worksheet
3. Ionic Compounds
     - Mahi Tuatahi: Form into table groups and find out the name of each ion in a column and compile them on the board (project the table)
     - Copy other groups names onto your own table
     - Notes on atoms vs ions using diagrams and electron shell configurations
     - Notes on creating ionic compounds
     - Use whiteboards in table groups to make compounds as a quiz/speed game
4. Ionic Compounds
    - Finish quiz/speed game
    - Ionic compounds Quizlet
    - Writing formulae worksheet #1

    - Whakamātau: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unjjfmfy7Xv74AHvVPbJpdXAqNialWporSM26jtDcXA/edit
14. Gas Tests
    - Instruct students to make notes in their books as they go through each whakamātau
    - Notes should include success criteria and a diagram for how to set up the whakamātau
	- Gas tests whakamātaus
	    - https://www.riskassess.co.nz/risk_assessment/8323197
	- Fill in notes on gas tests in the research document if time.

## Overview

An atom is made up of two distinct parts. The __nucleus__ and __electrons__.

- The __nucleus__ is the centre of the atom (__B__).
- The __electrons__ (__C__) move around the nucleus in a shell (__A__)
- If one orbit is a shell, all the shells together are called the __electron shells__ (__F__)
- The nucleus holds the vast majority of the mass and is made of two particles
- The __proton__ (__D__) and the __neutron__ (__E__)

> __Atomic Number__
> 
> The number of protons inside the nucleus.

> __Mass Number__
> 
> The number of protons + neutrons inside the nucleus.

__NB:__ In a _neutral_ atom, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons. Why?

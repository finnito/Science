## Mahi Tuatahi / Do Now

- Collect and glue in a sheet with named elements, ions and compounds.
- __Elements quiz!__
- If you scored 100% twice in a row, move on to the ions quiz.

<p class="ins">When finished, get out your device and start working on your experiment document from last period</p>

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. To write word equations to show a chemical reaction
2. To write symbol equations to show a chemical reactions with symbols of state

---

## Chemical Reactions

There are two ways we can show a chemical reaction on paper:

1. Word equations
2. Symbol equations

---

### Word Equations

All equations have three parts to them:

1. Reactants (left-hand side)
2. Products (right-hand side)
3. Arrow - means _goes to form_ not _equals_

$$
\begin{aligned}
	reactant1 + reactant2 \rightarrow product1 + product2
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Ngohe/Task: Write a word equation for this reaction

Ella puts 1cm of magnesium strip in 5ml of dilute hydrochloric acid and observes hydrogen gas put off and that the magnesium dissolves into magnesium chloride.

#### Whakatika / Answer

<!-- 
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{magnesium + hydrochloric acid} \rightarrow \text{hydrogen gas + magnesium chloride}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Ngohe/Task: Write a word equation for this reaction

Jake adds 1ml of copper sulfate to 1ml of sodium hydroxide and predicts that copper hydroxide and sodium sulfate will be produced.

---

#### Whakatika / Answer

<!--
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{copper sulfate} + \text{sodium hydroxide} \rightarrow \text{copper hydroxide} + \text{sodium sulfate}
\end{aligned}
$$
-->

### Symbol Equations

Symbol equations are very similar, except we use the symbols from the periodic table __and__ we have to give the _state_ of each reactant and product. The state goes in the subscript after the element/compound.

__Pātai:__ Discuss with your partner, what are the four states of matter that we use in chemistry?

|               | Solid | Liquid | Gas | Aqueous |
|:--------------|:------|:-------|:----|:--------|
| __Subscript__ | (s)   | (l)    | (g) | (aq)    |

- __Aqueous means that it is dissolved in solution__
- _(l)_ is very uncommon in Year 11, (aq) is much more common

#### Ngohe/Task: Write a symbol equation for this reaction

Ella puts 1cm of magnesium strip in 5ml of dilute hydrochloric acid and observes hydrogen gas put off and that the magnesium dissolves into magnesium chloride.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Mg_{(s)} + HCl_{(aq)} \rightarrow H_{2(g)} + MgCl_{(aq)}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

#### Ngohe/Task: Write a symbol equation for this reaction

Jake adds 1ml of copper sulfate to 1ml of sodium hydroxide and predicts that copper hydroxide and sodium sulfate will be produced.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    CuSO_{4(aq)} + NaOH_{(aq)} \rightarrow Cu(OH)_{2(s)} + Na_{2}SO_{4(s)}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Balancing Equations

- Equations are balanced by putting whole numbers in front of compounds/molecules
- We want there to be the same number of each atom on each side of the $\rightarrow$
- This is usually done through trial and error

---

### Tauria / Example

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Magnesium Metal + Oxygen Gas &\rightarrow Magnesium Oxide \newline
    Mg_{(s)} + O_{2(g)} &\rightarrow MgO_{(s)}
\end{aligned}
$$

|     | RHS | LHS |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Mg  |     |     |
| O   |     |     |

---

It is unbalanced!

|     | RHS | LHS |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Mg  | 1   | 1   |
| O   | 2   | 1   |

---

#### Step 1 {.c2}

<div>
Start by balancing the oxygen by putting a two in front of the $MgO$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Mg_{(s)} + O_{2(g)} &\rightarrow 2MgO_{(s)}
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>
<div>
|     | RHS | LHS |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Mg  | 1   | 2   |
| O   | 2   | 2   |
</div>

---

#### Step 2 {.c2}

<div>
Now the magnesium is unbalanced, so we need to put a two in front of the $Mg$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    2Mg_{(s)} + O_{2(g)} &\rightarrow 2MgO_{(s)}
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>
<div>
|     | RHS | LHS |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Mg  | 2   | 2   |
| O   | 2   | 2   |
</div>

Balanced!

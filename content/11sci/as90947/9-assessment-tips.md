## Assessment Tips

1. Collect a paper from the front of the classroom
2. Name it
3. Quietly read through it while everyone else arrives

---

### How the Assessment Works

| Day 1                | Day 2                | Day 3                     |
|:---------------------|:---------------------|:--------------------------|
| Write predictions    | Continue whakamātaus | Finish whakamātaus        |
| Write word equations |                      | Complete write-up         |
| Start whakamātaus    |                      | Do excellence comparisons |

---

### Achieved

For 2 out of the 6 reactions:

- Collecting information (observations) about a range of chemical reactions.
- Writing word equations to describe the chemical reactions.
- Classifying the chemical reactions.

---

### Merit

- __Achieved + the following for 2 out of 6 reactions__
- Explaining the classification of the chemical reactions.
- Completing symbol equations for the chemical reactions.

---

### Excellence

- __Merit + the following for 2 out of the 6 reactions__
- In depth discussion (may include justifying, elaborating, relating, analysing, links between the classification of the reactions, observations and equations).
- Completing balanced symbol equations for the chemical reactions.

---

## Making Observations

- Colour changes
- Gases given off
- Changes of states

---

## Justifying Your Prediction

- Relate your observations to the number of reactants
- Relate your observations to the number of products
- Relate the number of reactants/products to general reaction equations

---

### 3. Prediction

- Write a word equation
- You do not need to put states
- For precipitation reactions: state that a precipitate will form, and name it
- Include the solubility rule predicting the precipitate
    - E.g. _A precipitate of sodium hydroxide will form due to the solubility rule that says..._

---

### 4. Results

- Describe the reactants
    - State (l, g, s, aq)
    - Colour (green, colourless)
    - Shiny/matte
    - Transparency (transparent, cloudy, opaque, translucent)
- Describe the products
    - ^ As above
    - Gas given off/bubbles formed
    - Results of gas tests 

---

### 5. Conclusion

- __Word Equation__
    - Use a $\rightarrow$
    - No states on the word equation
    - State the charge of the ion if there are multiple options _e.g. Iron (II)_
    - Be careful with sulfates/sulfides

---

### 5. Conclusion

- __Symbol Equation__
    - Be careful with capitals: only the first letter is ever capitalised
    - The number of each element/ion goes at the bottom
    - Ensure that your formula are correct before you balance the equation!
    - $\xrightarrow{heat}$ when using a Bunsen
    - Balance the equation at the very end
    - DO NOT WRITE STATES (you do not need them for excellence)
    - DO NOT WRITE CHARGES (each compound should be neutral)

---

### 5. Conclusion

- __Type of Reaction__
    - Simply state precipitation/displacement/combination/decomposition
    - You do not need to give an equation with ABCDs, but you can use it in your reasons for choice of reaction below

---

### 5. Conclusion

- __Reasons__
    - E.g. precipitation because a dark green precipitate was formed
    - E.g. precipitation because the $Fe^{2+}$ and $Na^{+}$ ions swap their partners as expected $AB + CD \longrightarrow AD + CB$
    - E.g. displacement because a silver deposit forms on the metal, indicating displacement
    - E.g. displacement because (your metal) is more reactive than (other metal) indicating it would displace it
    - E.g. combination because (describe substance) formed when combusted, indicating it combined with something in the air

---

### 5. Conclusion

- __Comment__
    - Precipitation: relate to precipitate being formed as expected
    - Relate to number of reactants that are elements (A) or compounds (AB)
    - Relate to number of products that are element (C) or compounds (CD)
    - By comparing these, the reaction will match __only one__ of the general equations

---

#### Excellence

1. Those who want to learn how to do the excellence part of this assessment __please shift to the front right of the classroom__
2. Everyone else, __shift to the left side of the classroom__ and use these notes (linked on Classroom) to continue to improve your practice assessment answers & work on your research task

---

### 6. Compare & Contrast

- __Precipitation vs Displacement__
    - Give one or two similarities
    - Give one or two differences
    - Give a (balanced symbol) example equation from your six reactions, or from research, for each difference
    - Link to solubility rules for precipitates
    - Link to activity series for displacement
    - 

---

### 6. Compare & Contrast

- __Combination vs Decomposition__
    - Give one or two similarities
    - Give one or two differences
    - Give a (balanced symbol) example equation  from your six reactions, or from research, for each difference
    - Compare energy needed to do decomposition/combination
    - Compare difficulty of each reaction (combination usually needs more energy under more difficult conditions)

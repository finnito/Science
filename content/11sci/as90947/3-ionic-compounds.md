## Mahi Tuatahi

Open your book to your __table of ions__. In groups (below), use your devices to find out the names of the __ions__ of your column, and write the names on the board.

Copy the names of the ions into your book from the other groups!

## Ions

Ions are atoms that have __gained__ or __lost__ electrons in order to have a full valence shell.

> Valence: outermost

---

### Example

This is an oxygen atom. Copy the diagram into your book and give the electron shell configuration _e.g. [2,3]_

---

Making an ion is like rounding:

- Atoms with a less than half-full valence shell will perfer to __lose electrons__
- Atoms with a more than half-full valence shell will prefer to __gain electrons__

---

Think again about the oxygen atom and answer these questions:

1. Will it prefer to gain or lose electrons?
2. How many electrons will it need to gain/lose to have a full outer shell?

Copy this table into your own book and work in pairs to complete it.

|                                  | Oxygen Atom | Oxygen Ion |
|:---------------------------------|:------------|:-----------|
| __Electron Shell Configuration__ |             |            |
| __Number of Protons__            |             |            |
| __Number of Electrons__          |             |            |
| __Overall Charge__               |             |            |

|                                  | Oxygen Atom | Oxygen Ion          |
|:---------------------------------|:------------|:--------------------|
| __Electron Shell Configuration__ | [2, 6]      | [2, 8]<sup>2-</sup> |
| __Number of Protons__            | 8           | 8                   |
| __Number of Electrons__          | 8           | 10                  |
| __Overall Charge__               | 0           | 2-                  |

#### Writing Ions

- Writing ions comes in two parts: the element, and the charge.
- The charge goes in a superscript <sup>like this</sup>.
- The number goes before the charge.

\begin{aligned}
    O^{2-}
\end{aligned}

---

### Making Ionic Compounds

- To make ionic compounds we need the numbers in the superscript to balance to zero.
- To use more than one of an ion you use a subscript <sub>like this</sub>

\begin{aligned}
    Na^{+} + Cl^{-} \rightarrow NaCl \newline
    Cu^{2+} + 2OH^{-} \rightarrow Cu(OH)_{2}
\end{aligned}

## Electron Transfer

Ionic compounds form because:

- some atoms want to give away electrons to get a full valence shell (become positive)
- some atoms want to receive electrons to get a full valence shell (become negative)

By giving/receiving electrons they form an __ionic bond__ (electrostatic forces) and make a __neutral compound__.

1. Sodium chloride
2. Magnesium sulfate
3. Sodium sulfate
4. Magnesium chloride
5. Iron (III) oxide

### Whakatika

1. Sodium chloride: $NaCl$
2. Magnesium sulfate: $MgSO_{4}$
3. Sodium sulfate: $Na_{2}SO_{4}$
4. Magnesium chloride: $MgCl_{2}$
5. Iron (III) oxide: $Fe_{2}O_{3}$

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

- Recognise a combination reaction
- Define a combination reaction
- Know some common observations of combination reactions

## Combination (Synthesis) Reactions

> Chemical reaction where the atoms of one element reacts with the atoms of another element to __form a single compound__.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A + B &\longrightarrow AB
\end{aligned}
$$

## Combination Reactions with Oxygen

- Sometimes called __oxidation__ reactions
- When heat/light are produced it is known as __combustion__
- Most require heat for the reaction to occur (think activation energy)
- The product is more stable than the reactants
- The flame can have a unique color
    + E.g. Copper makes green flames and sulfur makes blue ones

### Tauria Tahi / Example One

When iron rusts (oxidates), the iron atoms combine with oxygen atoms (from the air) to form iron (III) oxide.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{iron} + \text{oxygen} &\rightarrow \text{iron (III) oxide} \newline
    4Fe_{(s)} + 3O_{2(g)} &\rightarrow 2Fe_{2}O_{3(s)}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Tauria Rua / Example Two

When magnesium metal reacts (combusts) with oxygen atoms (in the air) to form magnesium oxide. This happens in fireworks!

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{magnesium} + \text{oxygen} &\rightarrow \text{magnesium oxide} \newline
    2Mg_{(s)} + O_{2(g)} &\rightarrow 2MgO_{(s)}
\end{aligned}
$$

<p class="patai">What colour is the product?</p>

### Combination Reactions and Ionic Compounds

When metal elements combine with non-metal elements:

1. Valence electrons are transferred <mark>from the metal to the non-metal</mark>. 
2. The <mark>metal forms a positive ion</mark> & the non-metal forms a negative ion. 
3. The ions are <mark>held together by electrostatic forces</mark> of attraction (positive-negative).

### Pātai: NCEA 2018

Lead iodide can be formed by two different reactions: 

1. Reaction One: Heating lead metal in iodine vapour. 
2. Reaction Two: Adding lead nitrate solution to sodium iodide solution. 

Elaborate on these reactions. In your answer, you should: 

- identify each type of chemical reaction and justify your answer 
- refer to electron transfer, where appropriate 
- write a balanced symbol equation for each reaction

---

#### Whakatika / Answer

__identify each type of chemical reaction and justify your answer__

Reaction one is a combination (synthesis) reaction because two elements (lead and iodine) are being combined together to form a single compound (lead iodide). Also, heat is being applied and a metal is present.

__refer to electron transfer, where appropriate__

Each lead metal atom an electron to two different iondine atoms which becomes negatively charged ($I^{-}$), leaving the lead ion positively charged ($Pb^{2+}$). These oppositely charged ions then are electrostatically attracted together to form an ionic compound.

__write a balanced symbol equation for each reaction__

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{lead} + \text{iodine} &\rightarrow \text{lead iodide} \newline
    Pb_{(s)} + 2I_{(g)} &\rightarrow PbI_{2 (s)}
\end{aligned}
$$

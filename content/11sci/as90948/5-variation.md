## Ngā Whāinga Ako

- Understand the importance of variation

---

## Brainstorm: Variation<br/>What are some ways that humans vary?

---

## Continuous vs Discontinuous {.c2}

- We can split variation up into two different groups: continuous and discontinuous.
- Continuous is a spectrum like height or hair colour
- Discontinuous is things like attached or dangling earlobes

## Sources of Variation

There are four main sources of variation that we are interested in:

- Mutation
- Sexual reproduction
- Fertilisation
- Environment

---

### Mutation {.c2}

- Random changes in the base sequence of DNA that may result in a new allele forming.
- Many things can cause mutations: think radiation (e.g. UV & skin cancer)

---

### Sexual Reproduction (Meiosis) {.c2}

- Meiosis is the process through which your body produces gametes (sex cells). These are sperm and ova in humans.
- It produces cells that have only one allele for each gene (23 chromosomes) so that when it combines with the opposite gamete, a full 46 chromosomes are made.

---

### Fertilisation

- When sperm and ova fuse, it is a random event. So, the final combination is random chance.

---

### Environment

- In some organisms the environment alters the expression of a genotype. Food and nutrient availability, competition, light intensity and disease may modify an expected phenotype.

## Natural Selection

- The biological imperative for any organism is to __pass along its genes__.
- The better you are able to this, the more fit (biologically speaking) you are.
- Therefore, natural selection is about environmental pressures that cause some individuals to die, while others survive due to a slightly different phenotype!
- We can see that variation is key to surviving change.

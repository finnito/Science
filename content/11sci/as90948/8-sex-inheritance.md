## Sex Determination & Chromosomes {.c2}

- Males carry one X and one Y chromosome (XY)
- Females carry two X chromosomes (XX)
- Since males can give either an X or a Y chromosomes, the chromosome in the male gamete (sperm) determines the biological sex of the offspring.

### Fertalisation & Punnett Squares {.c2}

- In humans we need to fuse a sperm and an egg into a fertalised zygote.
- Therefore, we can visualise sex determination with a Punnett square.
- Complete this Punnett square and describe the genotypic and phenotypic ratios.
- Does the probability of a particular sex change with each fertalisation? Why / why not?

#### Answers / Whakatika {.c2}

- The genotypic ratio is 1XX:1XY or 50% XX and 50% XY.
- The phenotypic ratio is  1male:1 female or 50% male and 50% female.
- The probability does not change with each fertalisation because each fertalisation is an __independent event__ (one not affected by prior events).

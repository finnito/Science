2021
Q1a) Punnett square of sex inheritance (percentages, gametes)
Q1b) Explain sex determinism (fertilisation, fusion)
Q1c) Explain probability of next offspring being female (separate event, percentages
Q1d) Explain somatic vs. gametic diseases (environmental, somatic, not affecting gametes)
Q2a) Relationship between DNA, genes, alleles, phenotype (define and link)
Q2b) Discuss mutation helpfulness, passing onto next generation (helps survival, passed on through gametes, reduction in disease --> more change to reproduce and pass genes along, increase in number of people with allele/phenotype)
Q3a) How sexual reproduction causes variation (gamete formation, fertilisation, meiosis, crossing over, independent assortment, random)
Q3b) New combinations of genes (genetic variation, given rise to combinations of genes which better allow survival in environment)

2020
Q1a) Allele combinations
Q1b) How alleles form phenotypes (phenotype, genotype, DNA coding)
Q1c) Relationship between DNA, genes, alleles, mutations and phenotype (code for a trait, different form of a gene)
Q2a) Punnet square (pedigree chart)
Q2b) Pedigree charts
Q2c) Determining genotype from pedigree charts (alleles, heterozygous, homozygous, recessive, dominant)
Q2d) Somatic vs gametic infection/disease (gametes, genetics, environment)
Q3a) Define genetic variation (DNA, genes, alleles, ability to fight disease)
Q3b) Sexual reproduction and variation (meiosis, gametes, fertilisation, random assortment, crossing over)
Q3c) Variation and survival (alleles, genes, favourable traits, passing on)

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

- Understand and use the terms “genotype and phenotype”, “homozygous and heterozygous” and “dominant and recessive”.
- Know how to carry out genetic crosses using punnet squares and determine genotypic and phenotypic ratios.

### Some Definitions

- __Genotype:__ The genetic make-up of a cell that determines one of its characteristics
- __Phenotype:__ The observable characteristics of an individual due to its genotype

### Phenotype

### How do we describe the genotype?

- We use the words __dominant__ and __recessive__ to describe alleles.
- What is an allele?

---

#### Dominant Alleles

- A dominant allele will produce a certain phenotype, even in the presence of other alleles.
- For example, a brown eyes allele will create brown eyes even when paired with a blue eyes allele.
- If __B__ is brown and __b__ is blue: __BB__ and __Bb__ will both produce brown eyes.

---

#### Recessive Alleles

- A recessive allele will only produce a certain phenotype when in the presence of another of the same allele.
- For example, a blue eyes allele will only create blue eyes when paired with another blue eyes allele.
- If __B__ is brown and __b__ is blue: __BB__ and __Bb__ will both produce brown eyes, while only __bb__ will produce blue.

---

- Recall __homo__ means same and __hetero__ means different
- __BB__ is __homozygous dominant__
- __Bb__ is __heterozygous dominant__
- __bb__ is __homozygous recessive__

---

### Punnet Squares

- We can use punnet squares to determine the probability that two parents will produce offspring with a particular genotype, or with a particular phenotype.
- The father goes at the top of the square, and the mother on the left.
- We fill out the known genotypes of the parents and then complete the square.

---

If dad is __heterozygous dominant__ for brown eyes and mum is __homozygous recessive__ for blue eyes, complete this punnet square in your books.

### Test Crosses

A test cross used to determine the __genotype__ of an unknown organism. It is done by crossing the organism with an organism that is known to be __homozygous recessive__.

---

#### The Two Outcomes

There are two possible outcomes for a test cross.

1. The organism is __homozygous dominant__,
2. the organism is __heterozygous__.

### Question

A garden pea has two alleles for colour. __Y__ is the dominant allele for yellow, while __y__ is the recessive allele for green.

Mendel wants to figure out whether his yellow pea is __homozygous dominant__ or __heterozygous__. How can he do this?

---

#### Answer

He can breed the pea plants together many times and count the number of yellow and green pea plants produced. He can also perform two punnet squares to figure out which __genotype__ the yellow pea has e.g. YY x yy and Yy x yy.

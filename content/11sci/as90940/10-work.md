## Mahi Tuatahi

1. Write the date in your books
2. Discuss with the person next to you:
    1. What does the law of conservation of energy state?
    2. What unit is energy measured in?
3. Write your joint conclusion in your books!

---

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. Define __work__.
2. Name the unit of work and give its symbol.
3. Use $W = Fd$.

---

## Work

> The amount of energy transferred/transformed (gained/lost).

E.g. When you lift your backpack off the ground you are transferring some __chemical potential energy__ in your muscles into __gravitational potential energy__ in the backpack. You are doing __work__ on your backpack.

---

Work has the formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    work &= force \times distance \newline    
    W &= F \times d
\end{aligned}
$$

and is measured in Joules (J) because it is defined as __the amount of energy__ transferred/transformed.


---

### Pātai

Rearrange the formula $W=F \times d$ to:

1. Make $F$ the subject
2. Make $d$ the subject

---

#### Ngā Whakatika

$$
\begin{aligned}
    W &= F \times d \newline
    F &= \frac{W}{d} \newline
    d &= \frac{W}{F}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Pātai {.c2}

1. Sam does a deadlift and raises $20kg$ by $1m$. Calculate the work done.
2. Sarah hikes up Avalanche Peak. They have a mass of $55kg$, they start at $733m$ and do $605,000J$ of work to reach the top. How high did they climb?.

#### Whakatika Tahi

$$
\begin{aligned}
    W &= F \times d \newline
    W &= (m \times g) \times d \newline
    W &= (20 \times 10) \times 1 = 200J
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Whakatika Rua

$$
\begin{aligned}
    W &= F \times d \newline
    W &= (m \times g) \times d \newline
    605,000 &= (55 \times 10) \times d \newline
    \frac{605000}{55 \times 10} &= d = 1100m
\end{aligned}

### Matapaki/Discussion

Compare and contrast these formula with the person sitting next to you. Write your thoughts in your book.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    W &= F \times d \newline
    E_{p} &= m \times g \times h
\end{aligned}
$$

### Pātai {.c2}

1. Get your mahi kāinga booklet and open it to Q31.
2. Complete and mark Q31
3. What do you notice about the _distance_ value used? Is it horizontal or vertical? Why do you think that is?

    K:& \cr
    U:& \cr
    F:& \cr
    S+S:&

#### Whakatika Whā

$$
\begin{aligned}
    W &= F \times d \newline
    W &= (m \times g) \times d \newline
    W &= (62 \times 10) \times 46.2 = 28,644J
\end{aligned}
$$

We use the vertical distance, not the horizontal distance. Energy is not transferred/transformed when moving horizontally!

---

### Whakatika

- Work is __the amount of energy transferred/transformed__
- It is just a measure of energy
- In the vertical direction, __it is exactly the same as__ $E_{p}$!
- You can use either formula

### Pātai: Rocket {.c2}

A rocket is launched with an acceleration of $90ms^{-2}$. It has a mass of $5kg$ and it reaches a height of 2000m. __How much work did the rocket do to get the rocket to this height?__

#### Whakatika

All energy is transformed from chemical potential __to gravitational potential__.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    W = E_{p} &= m \times g \times h \newline
    &= 5 \times 10 \times 2000 = 100,000J
\end{aligned}
$$

__Extra: Q28__

---

#### Whakatika

a) _How much work does Chris (48 kg) do when he climbs up the stairs to the 2m diving platform?_

$$
\begin{aligned}
    W = E_{p} &= m \times g \times h \newline
    &= 48 \times 10 \times 2 = 960J
\end{aligned}
$$

---

b) _Ian's mass is 52 kg. Why did Ian do more work climbing up the 5 m ladder compared to Chris climbing up the 2 m ladder?_

Because $W=mgh$, if $m$ increases, the work increases. Also if $h$ increases, so does the work. Ian:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    W = E_{p} &= m \times g \times h \newline
    &= 52 \times 10 \times 5 = 2600J
\end{aligned}
$$

---

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. Define __power__.
2. Name the unit of power and give its symbol.
3. Be able to do a variety of power calculations.

---

## Power

> The rate at which energy is transferred/transformed.
> 
> The rate at which work is done.

---

- Power is measured in Joules per second ($J/s$), which is also known as a Watt ($W$)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    power &= \frac{work}{time} \newline
    P &= \frac{W}{t} \newline
\end{aligned}
$$

Write this formula so that $W$ and $t$ are the subject.

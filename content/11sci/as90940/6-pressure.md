## Ngā Whāinga Ako

Copy these learning outcomes and the date into your books!

1. Recap forces
2. Explain force and pressure in terms of everyday situations. Use $P = F/A$.

---

## Mahi Tuatahi

1. Calculate the __net__ force acting upon these objects:

2. What does an unbalanced force do to the motion of an object?

---

### Whakatika Rua

It causes the object to accelerate (or de-accelerate).

We know this because of the equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
    force &= mass\times acceleration \cr
    F &= m \times a
\end{aligned}
$$

---

## Pātai Toru

For the followig equation give the __name__ and __unit__ for each variable in the equation.

\begin{aligned}
    & F = m \times a
\end{aligned}

---

### Whakatika Toru

- F stands for __force__ and has units __Newtons (N)__
- m stands for __mass__ and has units __kilograms (kg)__
- a stands for __acceleration__ and has units __meters per second squared ($ms^{-2}$)__

---

## Pātai Whā

- What do you think of when you think of pressure?
- What affects the pressure exerted by an object?

---

### Pātai Rima

The most classic case of pressure is sharpening a knife. Why do we sharpen knives? What does sharpening a knife change about the knife?

## Pressure / _Pēhanga_

> The amount of force per square meter

$$
\begin{aligned}
    pressure &= \frac{force}{area} \cr
    P &= \frac{F}{A}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Force (F) is measured in __Newtons (N)__
- Area (A) is measured in __meters squared ($m^{2}$)__

---

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P &= \frac{F}{A} \cr
    P &= \frac{Newtons}{m^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Therefore, pressure is measured in Newtons per meters squared ($\frac{N}{m^{2}}$ OR $Nm^{-2}$)
- This is also known as a <mark>Pascal (Pa): $Pa = \frac{N}{m^{2}} = Nm^{-2}$</mark>
- You may use whichever unit you prefer.

## Calculating Pressure

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P = \frac{F}{A}
\end{aligned}
$$

1. Calculate the __pressure__ created by a force of $3N$ with an area of $0.5m^{2}$
2. Calculate the __area__  used by a force of $3N$ with pressure $7Pa$
3. Calculate the __force__ created by a pressure of $5Nm^{-2}$ with an area of $0.125m^{2}$

### Whakatika Tahi

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F&=3N, A=0.5m^{-2}, P=? \cr
    P &= \frac{F}{A} \cr
    P &= \frac{3}{0.5} \cr
    P &= 6Nm^{-2} = 6Pa
\end{aligned}
$$

### Whakatika Rua

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F&=3N, P=7Pa, A=? \cr
    P &= \frac{F}{A} \cr
    A &= \frac{F}{P} \cr
    A &= \frac{3}{7} \cr
    A &= 0.43m^{-2}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

### Whakatika Toru

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P&=5Nm^{-2}, A=0.125m^{-2}, F=? \cr
    P &= \frac{F}{A} \cr
    F &= PA \cr
    F &= 5 \times 0.125 \cr
    F &= 0.625N
\end{aligned}
$$

## Mahi Tuatahi (2018 Exam)

Jacob bikes down The Flying Nun. He and his bike have a mass of $82kg$ and he accelerates at $0.8ms^{-2}$.

1. Calculate the __net force__ acting upon Jacob and his bike to cause this acceleration
2. Draw a force diagram showing the forces acting upon Jacob as he accelerates
3. Describe the size and direction of the forces compared to each other (horizontal and vertical)

## Exam Question (2018)

Giovanni is running a 100m sprint. Each of his feet have a surface area of $200cm^{2}$ ($0.0200m^{2}$), which sink into the track. Together, his feet exert a pressure of $13000Pa$. Calculate Giovanni's weight.

---

### Whakatika

Because __weight__ is a force, we know that we are looking for $F$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P &= 13000Pa \cr
    A &= 0.02m^{2} \times 2 = 0.04m^{2} \cr
    F &= P \times A \cr
    F &= 13000 \times 0.04 \cr
    F &= 520N
\end{aligned}
$$

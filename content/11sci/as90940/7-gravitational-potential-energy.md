## Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. Give the symbols and units for potential energy.
2. Use the equation $E_{p} = m\times g \times \Delta h$

## Gravitational Potential Energy / _Pūngao Tō Ā-Papa_

> The potential an object has due to being at a particular position in a gravitational field.

__AKA__: The potential a mass has to fall due to being lifted up!

---

- All types of energy are measured in __Joules__
- Joules are given the shorthand unit: __J__

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E_{p} &= mass \times gravity \times height \cr
    E_{p} &= m \times g \times \Delta h
\end{aligned}
$$

## Whakatika Tahi

__Calculate the gravitational potential energy__ of a ball with mass, $0.5kg$ kicked onto a roof which is $3m$ high.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    m&=0.5kg, \Delta h = 3m, g=10ms^{-2}    && \text{(K)} \cr
    E_{p} &= ?                              && \text{(U)}\cr
    E_{p} &= mg\Delta h                     && \text{(F)}\cr
    E_{p} &= 0.5 \times 10 \times 3         && \text{(S)}\cr
    E_{p} &= 15J                            && \text{(S)}
\end{aligned}

## Whakatika Rua

__Calculate the height__ of a $100kg$ barbell that gained $1800J$ of gravitational potential energy.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    m&=100kg, E_{p}=1800J                   && \text{(K)} \cr
    \Delta h&= ?                            && \text{(U)} \cr
    E_{p}&=mg\Delta h                       && \text{(F)} \cr
    1800 &= 100 \times 10 \times \Delta h   && \text{(S)} \cr
    \Delta h &= \frac{1800}{1000} = 1.8     && \text{(S)} 
\end{aligned}

## Whakatika Toru

__Calculate the mass__ of a cat that climbed $5m$ into a tree and gained $400J$ of gravitational potential energy.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Delta h&=5m, E_{p} = 400J              && \text{(K)} \cr
    m &= ?                                  && \text{(U)}\cr
    E_{p} &= mg\Delta h                     && \text{(F)}\cr
    400 &= m \times 10 \times 5             && \text{(S)}\cr
    m &= \frac{400}{50} = 8kg               && \text{(S)}
\end{aligned}

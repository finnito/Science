## What is Acceleration?

> Acceleration is how quickly the velocity changes.

__e.g.__ A supercar will accelerate to 50km/hr faster than a cyclist. That is to say, the supercar has a greater acceleration.

---

## Calculating Acceleration

\begin{align*}
    acceleration &= \frac{\text{change in speed}}{\text{change in time}} \newline
    a &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \newline
\end{align*}

- __Velocity__ ($v$) has units meters per second ($ms^{-1}$)
- __Time__ ($t$) has units seconds ($s$)
- __Acceleration__ ($a$) has units meters per second per second ($m/s^{2}$ or $ms^{-2}$)

---

## Rearranging Equations

\begin{align*}
    a &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} && \text{v is divided by t} \newline
    a \times \Delta t &= \Delta v && \text{Undo the divide by multiplying} \newline
    \Delta t &= \frac{\Delta v}{a} && \text{Undo the multiplication by dividing}
\end{align*}


\begin{align*}
    v &= \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} && \text{d is divided by t} \newline
    v \times \Delta t &= \Delta d && \text{Undo the divide by multiplying} \newline
    \Delta t &= \frac{\Delta d}{v} && \text{Undo the multiplication by dividing}
\end{align*}

## Question 1 {.c2}

- A bee starts at rest and takes off from a flower and reaches a velocity of $0.75ms^{-1}$ in $0.5s$. Calculate it's acceleration.

## Question 1: Answer

1. __Knowns:__ $\text{time (t)} = 0.5s$, $\Delta v = v_{f} - v_{i} = 0.75 - 0 = 0.75ms^{-1}$
2. __Unknowns:__ $\text{acceleration (a)}$
3. __Formula:__ $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$
4. __Substitute:__ $a = \frac{0.75}{0.5}$
5. __Solve:__ $v = 1.5\frac{m}{s^{2}} = 1.5ms^{-2}$

## Question 2 {.c2}

A Bugatti Veyron accelerates from rest at $27.77ms^{-2}$ for $2.6s$. How fast is it travelling at after 2.6 seconds?

---

## Question 2: Answer

1. __Knowns:__ $\text{time (t)} = 2.6s$, $\text{acceleration (a)} = 27.77ms^{-2}$
2. __Unknowns:__ $\text{final velocity } v_{f}$
3. __Formula:__ $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{f} - v_{i}}{\Delta t}$
4. __Substitute:__ $27.77 = \frac{v_{f} - 0}{2.6}$
5. __Solve:__ $27.77 \times 2.6 = v_{f} = 72.2ms^{-1}$

## Question 3 {.c2}

A skydiver at rest jumps out of a plane. They accelerate at $9.8ms^{-2}$ until they reach a terminal velocity of $54ms^{-2}$. How long does it take them to reach this speed?

---

## Question 3: Answer

1. __Knowns:__ $\text{acceleration (a)} = 9.8ms^{-2}$, $\text{final velocity } (v_{f}) = 45ms^{-1}$
2. __Unknowns:__ $\text{time (t)}$
3. __Formula:__ $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{f} - v_{i}}{\Delta t}$

\begin{align*}
    9.8 &= \frac{54 - 0}{t} \newline
    9.8 \times t &=  54 \newline
    t &= \frac{54}{9.8} = 5.51s
\end{align*}

## Question 4 {.c2}

A runner is approaching the finish line, moving at $5.55ms^{-1}$ but needs to sprint to pass the person just in front of them to get 1st place. They accelerate for $3s$ to reach $6.3ms^{-1}$. What is their acceleration?

## Question 4: Answer

1. __Knowns:__ $v_{i} = 5.55ms^{-1}$, $v_{f} = 6.3ms^{-1}$, $\Delta t = 3s$
2. __Unknowns:__ $\text{acceleration (a)}$
3. __Formula:__ $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{f} - v_{i}}{\Delta t}$

\begin{align*}
    a &= \frac{6.3 - 5.55}{3} \newline
    a &= \frac{0.75}{3} =  0.25ms^{-2}
\end{align*}

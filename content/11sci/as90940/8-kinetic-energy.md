## Kinetic Energy?

> Kinetic energy is the energy that an object possesses due to its __velocity__!

---

### Calculating Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy depends on the __mass__ and __velocity__ of an object.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E_{k} &= \frac{1}{2} \times mass \times \text{velocity squared} \cr
    E_{k} &= \frac{1}{2} \times m \times v^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

### What does $v^{2}$ mean?

- It means $v \times v$
- This means we can also write the equation like this, if you find it easier:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E_{k} &= \frac{1}{2} \times m \times v \times v
\end{aligned}
$$

Mr LeSueur rides his bike to work at $32km/h$ ($8.89ms^{-1}$). Both he and his bike have a combined mass of $78kg$. __Calculate his kinetic energy__.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    m&=78kg, v=8.89ms^{-1}                          && \text{(K)} \cr
    E_{k} &= ?                                      && \text{(U)} \cr
    E_{k} &=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}                       && \text{(F)} \cr
    E_{k} &= \frac{1}{2} \times 78 \times 8.89^{2}  && \text{(S)} \cr
          &= 3082.3J                                && \text{(S)}

A dog with mass $22kg$ sprints across a field with a kinetic energy of $1100J$. __Calculate it's velocity.__

$$
\begin{aligned}
    m&=22kg, E_{k}=1100J                                && \text{(K)} \cr
    v &= ?                                              && \text{(U)} \cr
    E_{k} &=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}                           && \text{(F)} \cr
    1100 &= \frac{1}{2} \times 22 \times v^{2}          && \text{(S)} \cr
    \sqrt{\frac{1100 \times 2}{22}} &= v = 10ms^{-1}    && \text{(S)} 
\end{aligned}

A ball is bowled with energy $39.2J$ and velocity $28ms^{-1}$. __Calculate its mass__.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E_{k}&=39.2J, v=28ms^{-2}                        && \text{(K)} \cr
    m &= ?                                          && \text{(U)} \cr
    E_{k} &=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}                       && \text{(F)} \cr
    39.2 &= \frac{1}{2} \times m \times 28^{2}      && \text{(S)} \cr
    \sqrt{\frac{39.2 \times 2}{784}} &= m = 0.1kg   && \text{(S)}

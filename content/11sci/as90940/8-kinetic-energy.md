# L20: Mahi Tuatahi (2016 Exam)

- Rhiana is riding a horse along New Brighton Beach. __Each__ of the horse's hooves have a surface area of $0.0044m^{2}$ which sink into the sand when the horse stops. The horse exerts a total pressure of $200155Pa$.
- __Calculate the weight of the horse.__
    - Equation
    - Substitute
    - Solve

---

## Te Whakatika

A horse has four hooves, so the total surface area that the horse is exerting pressure through is $A = 0.0044 \times 4 = 0.0176m^{2}$

\begin{aligned}
    P &= \frac{F}{A} \newline
    200155 &= \frac{F}{0.0176} \newline
    200155 \times 0.0176 &= F = 3522.728N
\end{aligned}

## What is Kinetic Energy?

> Kinetic energy is the energy that an object possesses due to its __velocity__!

---

## Calculating Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy depends on the __mass__ and __velocity__ of an object.

\begin{aligned}
    E_{k} &= \frac{1}{2} \times mass \times \text{velocity squared} \newline
    E_{k} &= \frac{1}{2} \times m \times v^{2}
\end{aligned}

---

### What does $v^{2}$ mean?

- It means $v \times v$
- This means we can also write the equation like this, if you find it easier:

\begin{aligned}
    & E_{k} = \frac{1}{2} \times m \times v \times v
\end{aligned}

### Pātai Tahi

Mr LeSueur rides his bike to work at $32km/h$ ($8.89ms^{-1}$). Both he and his bike have a combined mass of $80kg$. __Calculate his kinetic energy__.

---

#### Whakatika Tahi

We know $m=80kg$ and $v=8.89ms^{-1}$, and we are looking for $E_{k}$.

\begin{aligned}
    E_{k} = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 \times 8.89^{2} \newline
    E_{k} = 3161.284J
\end{aligned}

### Pātai Rua

Sophie is skiing down Upper Fascination at Mt Hutt, and is trying to go really fast. Her combined mass is $60kg$ and she is moving at $60km/h$ ($16.67ms^{-1}$). __Calculate her kinetic energy__.

---

#### Whakatika Tua

We know $m=60kg$ and $v=16.67ms^{-1}$, and we are looking for $E_{k}$.

\begin{aligned}
    E_{k} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \times 16.67^{2} \newline
    E_{k} = 8336.667J
\end{aligned}

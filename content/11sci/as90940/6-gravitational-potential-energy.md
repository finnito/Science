## Gravitational Potential Energy / _Pūngao Tō Ā-Papa_

> The potential an object has to transfer energy (do work), due to being at a particular position in a gravitational field.

__AKA__: The potential a mass has to fall due to being lifted up!

---

- Energy is __always__ measured in Joules
- Joules are given the shorthand unit: __J__

\begin{aligned}
    E_{p} &= mass \times gravity \times height \newline
    E_{p} &= m \times g \times h
\end{aligned}

- Formula
- Substitution
- Answer

---

## Whakatika Rua

\begin{aligned}
    E_{p} &= m \times g \times h \newline
    &= 100 \times 10 \times 2 \newline
    &= 2000J
\end{aligned}

- Formula
- Substitution
- Answer

---

## Whakatika Toru

\begin{aligned}
    E_{p} &= m \times g \times h \newline
    &= 4 \times 10 \times 5 \newline
    &= 200J
\end{aligned}

- Formula
- Substitution
- Answer

---

## Whakatika Wha

\begin{aligned}
    E_{p} &= m \times g \times h \newline
    &= 0.3 \times 10 \times 4 \newline
    &= 12J
\end{aligned}

## Pātai Rimu

__Calculate the height__ of Mr Le Sueur, mass $71kg$, who ran up a hill and gained $142,000J$ of energy!

- Formula
- Substitution
- Answer

---

## Whakatika Rimu

\begin{aligned}
    E_{p} &= m \times g \times h \newline
    142,000 &= 71 \times 10 \times h \newline
    142,000 &= 710 \times h \newline
    \frac{142,000}{710} &= h \newline
    200m = h
\end{aligned}

## Pātai Ono

__Calculate the mass__ a dog who climbed a $2.5m$ obstacle at the dog park and gained $625J$ of energy.

- Formula
- Substitution
- Answer

---

## Whakatika Ono

\begin{aligned}
    E_{p} &= m \times g \times h \newline
    625 &= m \times 10 \times 2.5 \newline
    625 &= m \times 25 \newline
    \frac{625}{25} &= m \newline
    25kg = m
\end{aligned}

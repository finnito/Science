Re: <First> (11SCI)

<First> has been working diligently on the Mechanics topic in Science for the past six weeks and the topic is coming to a close. <He> will be having a practice assessment for this external next Monday (09/05/22). <He> will get another practice opportunity in Term 3 during the Mock Exam Period before sitting the test in Term 4 for credits.

As part of <his> revision <he> has four excellent resources:
1. All work was posted on Google Classroom
2. All my teaching notes are linked on Google Classroom but can also be found here: https://putaiao.nz/11sci/as90940/
3. <His> sciPad textbook has a wealth of notes and questions to practice.
4. I created a digital "Homework Booklet" that is made of past NZQA exams. This is the best thing that <First> can work through in preparation for <his> test. We have completed a number of questions in class and as homework, but there are many that we have not touched. <First> should aim to work through as many of these as possible in preparation.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns.

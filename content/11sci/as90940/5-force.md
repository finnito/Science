## Mahi Tuatahi

Brainstorm situations where force is involved, things that cause force and how it can be used in a __Physics__ context on the board!

## Defining Force

Force is __push__, __pull__, __friction__, __thrust__ etc. and is measured in __Newtons (N)__.

Forces have a size (1, 2, 3, 4) and a direction (left, right, up, down, $40^{\circ}$).

## Pātai: How Forces Act

Consider sitting on your seat. What forces are acting upon you?

Draw a diagram and illustrate the forces acting upon you.

---

## Force Diagrams

- Represent yourself as a box. Always.
- Label your center of mass as a dot.
- Draw forces as arrows
    + Longer arrows indicate __more force__
    + Arrow should start from the center of mass
    + Arrow points in the direction the force is acting
- Arrows should be labelled. E.g. A push force might be $F_{p}$
- Arrows should be labelled with their numerical value when known. E.g. $F_{p} = 120N$
- Equally sized forces can be indicated with a _slash_ through the lines

## Pātai: How Forces Act - Improved!

Draw an improved force diagram of all the forces acting upon you.

## Balanced Forces

Think and discuss with the people around you:

Sitting on your chair, are the forces acting on you balanced or unbalanced? How do you know? What does it feel like?

---

## Balanced Forces

- If a force is balanced, the object is in equilibrium and __does not accelerate__
- If the forces are unbalanced, the object is not in equilibrium and __does accelerate__

## Mahi Tuatahi

Sketch these diagrams in your book and find the _net force_ in the horizontal and vertical directions.

---

### Vertical and Horizontal Forces

- Vertical and horizontal forces are separate. They do not affect each other.
- Forces can only cancel each other out when they are in _opposite_ directions.

## Force & Weight {.c2}

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Force &= mass \times accel. \cr
    F &= m \times a \cr\cr
     &= kg \times ms^{-2} \cr
     &= kgms^{-2} \cr
     & = N
\end{aligned}
$$

- Force acting upon a mass will create an acceleration
    + Gravity (acceleration) acting upon mass (you) is felt as a force (weight)
- Weight is a force. Gravity is an acceleration.

## Weight vs Mass


|                Mass                |                 Weight                 |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| The amount of matter in something. | The force matter feels due to gravity. |
| Measured in $kgs$                  | Measured in Newtons (N)                |
| Is constant                        | Changes with acceleration/gravity      |
| Cannot be measured directly        | Can be measured using a scale          |

## Mahi Tuatahi

Complete the questions on the last page of the worksheet from last period!

## Your Weight

- The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is $10\frac{m}{s^{2}}$.
    + Objects fall at different rates due to friction/drag. This reduces the net force, and thus acceleration experienced.
- Calculate your weight on Earth using $F=ma$
- Use this website to visualise your weight on other planets: https://exploratorium.edu/ronh/weight/

## Net Force

- Net force is the resultant force in the x and y directions
- If the forces are equal and opposite, there is zero net force
- If there is zero net force, acceleration is zero
- We cannot know if the object is stationary or moving at a constant velocity without more information from the question

## Terminal Velocity {.c2}

- Friction forces increase as the velocity of an object increases
- When friction and weight forces are balanced, the object stops accelerating
- This is terminal velocity!

---

## Terminal Velocity {.c2}

- The object starts from rest at the top of the jump
- Its velocity increases due to the acceleration due to gravity (weight force)
- The friction force (drag) increases with velocity until they become balanced
- The velocity becomes constant

## Task

[Question 18 and then Question 19 from the mahi kāinga booklet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bkneQc47Nl5w2a7EaORBRw_Ums-2IINa4ZEq_smG1YE/edit#heading=h.wnjqrqhzhzzu)

## Mahi Tuatahi

1. Do you recall $v=\frac{d}{t}$? calculate the velocity of a cyclist that travels $100m$ in $15s$.
2. What is the difference between mass and weight?
3. Calculate the __weight__ of a $1.5kg$ mass on Earth.
4. After $10s$ a runner has accelerated from __rest__ to $3m/s$

## L16: Mahi Kāinga Booklet Q19

- To answer this question, carefully read the question and the things that you should include in your answer.
- A good way to structure it would be for each point:
    - Draw a force diagram
    - Explain the forces (net force, balanced, unbalanced, horizontal, vertical)
    - Explain the acceleration of the rocket due to the forces, and thus its speed
    - Explain what is causing friction, and the relative size of those friction forces

---

## Mahi Kāinga Booklet Q20

- Right is constant velocity, left is moving to the left but slowing down.
- For each bird:
    - Describe the net force (balanced, unbalanced, direction)
    - Relate this to the acceleration of the bird and therefore the velocity

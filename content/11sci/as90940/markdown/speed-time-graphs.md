## Speed-Time Graphs {.c2}

- The gradient of a distance-time graph is the __velocity__
- The gradient of a speed-time graph is the __acceleration__
- The area under a speed-time graph is the __distance travelled__

## Calculating Acceleration {.c2}

![](../assets/2-velocity-time-graph.png)

\begin{align*}
    a &= \frac{rise}{run} \newline
    a &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \newline
    a &= \frac{v_{f} - v_{i}}{\Delta t}
\end{align*}

## Finding the Distance

- Calculate the area under the __speed-time graph__ to find the distance travelled
- Break it up into rectangles & triangles to calculate the area

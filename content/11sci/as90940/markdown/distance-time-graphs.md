## Distance-Time Graphs

We can plot a graph with __time on the x-axis__ and __distance on the y-axis__ to help us visualise data. Graphs are very useful to easily gain information from measurements.

- __Flat gradient__: Stationary
- __Negative gradient__: Moving towards

- Start the axis at zero
- Title each axis
- Units on each axis
- Title the graph
- Use a ruler
- Make your scale even

## Calculating Velocity From Graphs

\begin{align*}
    & v = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} \\\\
    & v = \frac{rise}{run}
\end{align*}

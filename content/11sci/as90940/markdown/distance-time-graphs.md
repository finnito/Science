## Distance-Time Graphs {.c2}

- We can plot a graph with __time on the x-axis__ and __distance on the y-axis__ to help us visualise data.
- __Distance-time__ graphs tell us about the velocity of the object!

- __Positive gradient__: Moving away
- __Flat gradient__: Stationary
- __Negative gradient__: Moving towards

## Calculating Velocity From Graphs {.c2}

\begin{align*}
    & v = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} = \frac{d_{f} - d_{i}}{t_{f} - t_{i}} \\
    & v = \frac{rise}{run}
\end{align*}

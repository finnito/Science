## Akoranga 21: Mahi Tuatahi:

1. Write the date in your book
2. Brainstorm on the board what types of energy are there?

---

## Ngā Whāinga Ako

1. Identify energy changes.
2. Use $E_{k} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$
3. Explain the conservation of mechanical energy in free fall situations (e.g. ball sports)

---

## Types of Energy

- Gravitational potential energy
- Heat energy
- Sound energy
- Light energy
- Elastic potential energy
- Electrical energy etc.

---

### What do they have in common?

- All energy is measured in __Joules__ ($J$).
- A transfer of energy is called __work__, measured in $J$.

---

## Conservation of Energy

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.

- This means that gravitational potential energy can be transformed into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy into other forms of energy.
- It is always _taken_ from somewhere, never created from nothing.

---

Written as an equation, this can mean:

\begin{align*}
    E_{k} &= E_{p} \newline
    \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} &= mgh
\end{align*}

In fact, we can make any two energy equations equal to each other! E.g. Spring potential energy and kinetic.

---

- We can convert one type of energy into another through mathematics!
- This is only true in a __frictionless world__ where no energy is lost through heat/sound/light

---

### Pātai

Mr Le Sueur has mass 71kg and has climbed a tree 4.5m tall to jump into a lake. How fast will he be traveling when he hits the water?

- Starts with $E_{p}$, so calculate it
- Then transformed all to $E_{k}$, so put known values into $E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$

---

#### Whakatika

\begin{align*}
    E_{p} &= mgh = 71 \times 10 \times 4.5 = 3195J \newline
    E_{k} &= E_{p} \newline
    E_{k} &= \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} \newline
    3195 &= \frac{1}{2} \times 71 \times v^{2} \newline
    \frac{3195 \times 2}{71} = 90 &= v^{2} \newline
    \sqrt{90} = 9.49ms^{-1} &= v
\end{align*}

## Tūhura: Marble Drop

1. Come over to the demo bench to see the setup
2. Open Google Classroom and do the tūhura!

# Akoranga 22 Mahi Tuatahi

Read page 55 and 56 of your sciPAD to remind yourself of some types of energy and how it is transformed between different types.

Then answer __Question 1 on page 59__.

---

In Physics we live in an idealised world where friction does not exist and energy is transformed with 100% efficiency.

This means that 100% of elastic potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, in the case of the rubber band.

It means that 100% of gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy in the case of a sky diver.

## Pātai: Do you recall the law of conservation of energy?

---

## Conservation of Energy

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed

We investigated this last term by calculating the __gravitational potential energy__ of a marble at the top of a tube and predicting how fast it would be moving at the bottom of the tube if __all__ of the $E_{p}$ was transformed into kinetic energy $E_{k}$.

---

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed

- This means that we can say $E_{k} = E_{p}$
- In words, all kinetic energy is transformed into potential energy, or vice versa.

### Pātai: Homework Booklet Q40

- Open homework booklet 40
- 40a is an achieved level question
- 40b is an excellence level question
    - start by identifying the change in energy
    - then use it to calculate the speed if all of that energy is transformed into kinetic energy

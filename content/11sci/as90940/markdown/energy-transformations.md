## What Other Types of Energy Are There?

There are many types of energy in the universe:

- Gravitational potential energy
- Heat energy
- Sound energy
- Light energy
- Elastic potential energy
- Electrical energy

---

### What do they have in common?

- All energy is measured in __Joules__ ($J$).
- A change in energy is called __work__  (measured in Joules).

---

## Conservation of Energy

- Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
- This means that gravitational potential energy can be transformed into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy into other forms of energy. It is always _taken_ from somewhere, never created from nothing.

# Mahi Tuatahi

Read page 55 and 56 of your sciPAD to remind yourself of some types of energy and how it is transformed between different types.

Then answer __Question 1 on page 59__.

In Physics we live in an idealised world where friction does not exist and energy is transformed with 100% efficiency.

This means that 100% of elastic potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, in the case of the rubber band.

It means that 100% of gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy in the case of a sky diver.

# Mahi Tuatahi

Read page 55 and 56 of your sciPAD to remind yourself of some types of energy and how it is transformed between different types.

Then answer __Question 1 on page 59__.

In Physics we live in an idealised world where friction does not exist and energy is transformed with 100% efficiency.

This means that 100% of elastic potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, in the case of the rubber band.

It means that 100% of gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy in the case of a sky diver.

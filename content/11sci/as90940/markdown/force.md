# Starter

Brainstorm situations where force is involved, things that cause force and how it can be used in a __Physics__ context on the board!

---

# Force

Force has lots of applications in our world! Everything from cars, to aeroplanes, tug-of-war, sports and even bio-mechanics!

## Defining Force

Force is a __push__ or a __pull__ and is measured in __Newtons (N)__.

Forces have a size (1, 2, 3, 4) and a direction (left, right, up, down, $40^{\circ}$).

---

## How Forces Act

Consider you sitting on your seat. What forces are acting upon you?

Draw a box to represent yourself, with arrows coming out of the box to represent the forces. Make sure to label them!

## Force Diagram {.c2}

- Longer arrows indicate __more force__, and vice versa
- The arrow points in the direction the force is acting
- Arrows should be labelled $F_{name}$

---

## Balanced Forces

Think and discuss with the people around you:

Sitting on your chair, are the forces acting on you balanced or unbalanced? How do you know? What does it feel like?

---

## Balanced Forces

- If a force is balanced, the object is in equilibrium and __does not accelerate__
- If the forces are unbalanced, the object is not in equilibrium and __does accelerate__

### Vertical and Horizontal Forces

- Vertical and horizontal forces are separate. They do not affect each other.
- We can _balance_ them to find out the __net force__ in the vertical and horizontal directions.
- If we compare them and they are the same, then forces are balanced. If they are different, forces are unbalanced.

## Force & Weight {.c2}

\begin{align*}
    Force = mass \times acceleration \\
    F = ma
\end{align*}

- Force acting upon a mass will create an acceleration
- An acceleration acting upon a mass is felt as a force
- ^ Gravity (acceleration) acting upon mass (you) is felt as a force (weight)
- Weight is a force

---

## Weight vs Mass


| Mass  | Weight  |
|---|---|
| Measured in $kgs$  | Measured in Newtons  |
| Is constant  | Changes with acceleration/gravity |
| Cannot be measured directly  | Can be measured using a scale  |

## Your Weight

- The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is $10\frac{m}{s^{2}}$.
- Calculate your weight on Earth using $F=ma$
- Use this website to visualise your weight on other planets: https://exploratorium.edu/ronh/weight/

---

## Starter

Complete the questions on the last page of the worksheet from last period!

---

## Types of Forces {.c2}

- __Down__: Weight (due to gravity)
- __Up__
    - Lift (planes, birds, things with wings)
    - Bouyancy (floating in water)
    - Support (rigid physical connections)
- __Faster__: Push/thrust forces (rockets, rugby)
- __Slower__: Generally called _resistive_ forces
    - Drag (water/air)
    - Friction (hard materials)

---

## Force Diagrams

- Equal and opposite forces should be the same length
- Greater forces have longer arrows
- Accelerating means unbalanced forces
- Balanced (zero net force) means no acceleration (constant velocity)

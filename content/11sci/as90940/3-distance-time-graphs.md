## Distance-Time Graphs {.c2}

- We can plot a graph with __time on the x-axis__ and __distance on the y-axis__ to help us visualise data.
- <mark>__Distance-time__ graphs tell us about the velocity of the object!</mark>

- __Positive gradient__: Moving away
- __Flat gradient__: Stationary
- __Negative gradient__: Moving towards

## Calculating Velocity From Graphs {.c2}

![](../assets/1-distance-time-graph.png "Distance-Time Graph")

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}
    v &= \text{ gradient} \cr
    v &= \frac{rise}{run} \cr
    v &= \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} = \frac{d_{f} - d_{i}}{t_{f} - t_{i}} \cr
\end{aligned}
$$

e.g.
$$
\begin{aligned}
    v_{A} &= \frac{d_{f} - d_{i}}{t_{f} - t_{i}} = \frac{30000 - 0}{3600 - 0} \cr
    v_{A} &= 8.33ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

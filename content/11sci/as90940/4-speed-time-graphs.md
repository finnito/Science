## Mahi Tuatahi

![](../assets/speed-time-mahi-tuatahi.png)

Calculate and describe the velocity in each section of this distance-time graph. Time is in minutes.

## Speed-Time Graphs {.c2}

- The gradient of a distance-time graph is the __velocity__
- The gradient of a speed-time graph is the __acceleration__
- The area under a speed-time graph is the __distance travelled__

## Calculating Acceleration {.c2}

![](../assets/2-velocity-time-graph.png)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    a &= \frac{rise}{run} \cr
    a &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \cr
    a &= \frac{v_{f} - v_{i}}{t_{f} - t_{i}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Pātai {.c2}

1. Calculate the acceleration for the positive acceleration section
2. Show, with maths, the acceleration is zero for the middle section
3. Calculate the acceleration for the negative acceleration section

## Finding the Distance {.c2}

![](../assets/2-velocity-time-graph.png "Velocity-Time Graph")

- Calculate the area under the __speed-time graph__ to find the distance travelled
- Break it up into rectangles & triangles to calculate the area
- Finding area of a rectangle is $A = B \times H$
- On the graph $d = t \times v$
- This should look familiar from $v=\frac{d}{t} \rightarrow d = v \times t$!

1. Find the distance travelled in sections A, B and C
2. Find the total distance travelled
3. Describe the acceleration in each of A, B and C
4. Describe the velocity in each of A, B and C

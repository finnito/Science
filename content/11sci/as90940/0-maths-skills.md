## What does $\epsilon 3$ mean on the calculator?

- $1\epsilon 3$ is the calculator's way of writing $1 \times 10^{3}$
- Similarly, $\epsilon -3$ means $\times 10^{-3}$
- This is called scientific form.
	+ $1\epsilon +3 = 1 \times 10^{3} = 1,000$ <mark>you move the decimal place right</mark>
	+ $1\epsilon -3 = 1 \times 10^{-3} = 0.001$ <mark>you move the decimal place left</mark>
- <mark>__Never__ write $\epsilon$ in your equations. __Always__ use $\times 10^{x}$</mark>

## Ngā Whainga Ako:

- To explain how reactions happen due to collisions between particles,
- To explain the term __activation energy__,
- To state the factors that affect the rate of reaction.

---

## Reactions, Particles and Collisions {.c2}

- Particles in liquids and gases can move freely which allows them to _react_ easily.
- A reaction _can_ take place when particles collide.

The number of reactions that occur depends on:

- the __frequency__ of successful collisions (with correct orientation) between particles,
- and the __energy__ with which particles collide.

If particles collide with less energy than the _activation energy_, they will not react. The particles will just bounce off each other.

Similarly, if they collide with the wrong orientation they will not react.

---

## Activation Energy {.c2}

The kinetic energies of the two colliding particles are added. If the sum of their energy is greater than the activation energy, the collision is successful and a reaction takes place.

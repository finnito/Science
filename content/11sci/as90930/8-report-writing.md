## The Aim

What is the objective of your experiment?

An aim describes what you will be investigating (the purpose of the experiment). Keep it simple but specific. One sentence long.

> e.g. The aim of this experiment is to investigate the relationship between __[concentration/surface area/temperature]__ and the rate of reaction for __[your reactants here]__.
> 
> The aim of this experiment is to investigate the relationship between surface area and the rate of reaction for calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid.

---

## The Hypothesis

> A prediction for the outcome of the experiment.

- It should be __specific__ and __testable__
- It must make a prediction about the effect of your _independent variable_ on your _dependent variable_.

> e.g. I think that [_your dependent variable here_] will [_increase/decrease_] when the [_your independent variable here_] is [increased/descreased].
> 
> I think that the rate of reaction will be highest with calcium carbonate powder. For example, the time taken to produce 10ml of gas will be the lowest with calcium carbonate powder.

---

## Independent Variable

> The variable that you will change throughout the experiment.

- You will only change __one thing about one reactant__.
- For Year 11 this will be one of: surface area, temperature, concentration or presence of a catalyst
- Where possible you should include the 3-5 increments you will use, plus the unit.

> e.g. We will change the temperature of the hydrochloric acid. We will use 10C, 20C, 30C, and 60C.

---

## Dependent Variable

> The variable being measured.

- It should have a well-defined endpoint (e.g. 10ml of gas)
- It is a way to indirectly measure the rate of reaction.
- Be specific.

> e.g. We will measure the time taken to produce $10ml$ of carbon dioxide gas as an indirect measure of the rate of reaction.

---

## Control Variables

> Things that you are keeping __constant__ in between trials.

- Control variables allow a test to be fair
- Control variables allow a method to be __reliable__
- Control variables should mean that results are consistent
- They allow you to draw a casual relationship between the thing you are changing (independent) and the thing that you are measuring (dependent).
- <mark>Without control variables, you cannot be sure that the thing you are changing was the __sole__ influence on your measurements.</mark>
- Include __at least four control variables__ in your report and __explain how you will control them__.
- It is important to include an explanation when possible.

For example:

- We will use the same volume of hydrochloric acid each time, measured with a measuring cylinder.
  + If the volume of acid used each time was different there would be a different number of hydrochloric acid molecules available to react. This would affect the number of possible collisions and therefore the rate of reaction.
- We will use the same concentration of hydrochloric acid each time (provided by school).
  + If the concentration of hydrochloric acid changed, there would be a different number of hydrochloric acid molecules available to react. This would affect the number of possible collisions and therefore the rate of reaction.
- We will use the same temperature of hydrochloric acid each time (measured with a thermometer).
  + If the temperature of the hydrochloric acid changed, the molecules would have different kinetic energies. This means that the probability that a particle has enough energy to surpass the activation energy would be affected. This in turn would affect the rate of reaction.
- We will use the same mass of calcium carbonate each time (measured with a balance).
  + If the mass of calcium carbonate were to change, there would be a different number of calcium carbonate particles available to react. This would change the number of possible collisions and therefore the rate of reaction.

---

## Method

> A method should be a sequential set of steps that any uninformed person could follow to perform the exact same experiment.

- Give a list of necessary equipment (be specific about beaker sizes etc.)
- Use numbered, short, steps
- Give directions as commands.
	+ Measure 3g of calcium carbonate powder with a balance into a beaker."
- Some steps may be repeated while the independent variable is changed.
	+ "Repeat steps 3-7 three times for each of large chips, small chips and powder of calcium carbonate."
- Indicate when something is to be recorded and how to calculate the relevant average.
- Indicate if equipment needs to be washed/reset between trials.

---

## Data + Results

- Design a table to record your results __before__ you start the experiment/whakamātau.
- Think about how many trials you will do, as well as an average.
- This is also a place to make a note of anything unusual that occurred during your experiment, or if anything went wrong etc.

A table might look something like this:

<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky"></th>
    <th class="tg-7btt" colspan="4">Time to produce 10ml of carbon dixoide gas (s)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Calcium Carbonate Form</td>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Trial 2</td>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Trial 2</td>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Trial 3</td>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Average</td>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Powder</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">3.5s</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">3.0s</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">3.3s</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">3.27s</td>

## Calculations

When calculating an average, you should give an example of how you did it so that another Scientist can see the process.

__Calculating an Average__: Add up all your trials and divide by the number of trials.

> E.g. To calculate the averages for our results we took the three trials, added them together and divided by three like so: (3.5 + 3.0 + 3.3) / 3 = 3.27s

---

## Graphs {.c2}

Graphs are an important tool to help visualise patterns in data.

- You will draw a graph by hand in the test.
- A graph should have the following:
  + Independent (thing you are changing) on the x-axis
  + Dependent (thing you are measuring) on the y-axis
  + __Plot the averages__
  + A title
  + X and Y axis labels + units
  + Data points indicated with crosses
  + A smoooth line of best fit
  + __DO NOT JOIN THE DOTS__
  + X and Y axes starting at zero
  + Even scale on the X and Y axes

## Conclusion

- Link your aim and hypothesis to the data you gathered.
- Summarise your data by stating the trend.
- Give an example comparison of two data points.
- Explain whether this supported your hypothesis or not and whether you achieved your aim.

> e.g. In our experiment we investigated [_your aim here_] and we found that when [_your data summary here_]. This is reflected in our data, for example [_your example data here_]. This [_supports/does not support_] our hypothesis that [_your hypothesis here_].

---

## Discussion/Evaluation

- Discuss any mistakes that were made (past tense)
- Discuss improvements/changes to your method that were made (past tense)
- Discuss future improvements that could be made to your method
- Discuss what your findings suggest about what you are modelling - this is where you bring in some __Science and research!__.
  + For Year 11 this means a discussion of collision theory and rates of reaction specific to this experiment.
  + Consider writing the following:
    * A description of the how a reaction occurs (collision + activation energy + orientations)
    * A description of how your independent variable affects collision theory. This would include effects on the number of collisions, probability of successful collisions where appropriate.
    * A description of your data trend compared to accepted theories (what you got taught in class)
    * A description of how your measurement of something (e.g. gas) is a vaild way to measure the rate of reaction. E.g. Gas production is a direct result of a successful collision, and is therefore valid.
- Discuss the reliability of your data
- Discuss the validity of your method

---

## Reliability

- __What does it tell you?__ 
  + The extent to which the __results can be reproduced__ when the research is repeated under the same conditions.
- __How is it assessed?__
  + By checking the __consistency of results__ between each trial of the increments of the independent variable.
- __How does it relate to validity?__
  + A reliable measurement is not always valid: the results might be reproducible, but they’re not necessarily correct.

> e.g. Looking at our results we can see that each trial of the different increments of our independent variable are similar to each other. This means that our dependent variable is well controlled. These results should therefore be reproducible by other scientists. However, this does not indicate that these results are _correct or valid_.

<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky"></th>
    <th class="tg-7btt" colspan="4">Time to produce 10ml of carbon dixoide gas (s)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Calcium Carbonate Form</td>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Trial 2</td>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Trial 2</td>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Trial 3</td>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Average</td>
  </tr>

<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Powder</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">3.5s</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">3.0s</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">3.3s</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">3.27s</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Small Chips</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Large Chips</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If you are getting a wide variety in results, you may need to re-work your method by adding further control variables or clearer instructions so the trials are closer together.f

## Validity

- __What does it tell you?__
  + The extent to which the results really measure what they are supposed to measure (model vs real world).
- __How is it assessed?__
  + By checking __how well the results correspond to established theories__ and other measures of the same concept. Do your results match previous research?
- __How does it relate to reliability?__
  + A valid measurement is generally reliable: if a test produces accurate results, they should be reproducible.

> e.g. Theories, research and past experiments show that when the surface area of a reactant is increased, the rate of reaction is also increased. Our data shows the same trend. This indicates that our experiment is sufficiently controlled and that we are _actually_ measuring the influence of surface area on the rate of reaction.

## Changing Surface Area

- Increasing the surface area means that there is more area for particles to collide
- This increases the number of collisions every second
- This increases the rate of reaction
- It __does not__ increase the probability of successful collisions as it does not change the energy of the particles.

---

To change the surface area you can use smaller chips of material, or even a power.

### Whakamātau: Writing an Experiment

- Your task is to write the full instructions for, and the complete an experiment to investigate how changing the surface area of a reactant affects the rate of reaction.
- A scaffold has been given to you on Google Classroom.
- Work in groups of 3-4
- Come and show me your group document before you start the experiment!

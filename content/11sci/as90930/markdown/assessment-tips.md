### Step 1: Aim & Hypothesis

In your group:

1. Title your experiment
2. Come up with an __aim__ (What are you investigating? Be specific.)
3. Come up with a __hypothesis__ (What do you predict? Be specific.)

---

### Step 2: Variables

- __Independent Variable__: The variable that you will change. What are we changing? Include units, measurement apparatus & range of measurements.
- __Dependent Variable__: The variable being measured. What are you measuring? Include units & measurement apparatus.

---

### Step 3: Control Variables & Reliability

- __Control Variable__: Things that you are keeping __constant__. What will you not change throughout your experiment?
- __Reliability__: An experiment is reliable if the results are within x seconds of each other when the method is repeated. The same method must give the same results each time.

---

### Step 4: Method

- Give you method as a numbered list,
- List what equipment you will need (e.g. a 100ml beaker; 25ml of diluted $HCl$),
- Break things up into small steps and say when you repeat a set of steps,

---

### Step 4: Continued

- State your range of measurement for your independent variable, its units and how you will measure it,
- States some control variables and how to control them during the experiment.

---

### Step 5: Data/Results

- Design a table to record your results __before__ you start the experiment,
- You will need to think about how many trials you are going to do, how many measurements you will make and calculating an average.

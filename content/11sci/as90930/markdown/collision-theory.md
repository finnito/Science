## Kaupapa/outcomes:

- To explain how reactions happen due to collisions between particles
- To explain the term ‘activation energy’ 
- To describe the factors that affect the reaction rate.

## Reactions, particles and collisions

- Reactions take place when particles collide with a certain amount of energy
- The minimum amount of energy needed for the particles to react is called the activation energy, and is different for each reaction

---

The rate of a reaction depends on two things: 

- the __frequency__ of collisions between particles,
- the __energy__ with which particles collide.

If particles collide with less energy than the activation energy, they will not react. The particles will just bounce off each other.

## Changing the Rate of Reaction

Anything that increases the number of successful collisions between reactant particles will speed up a reaction.

- increased __temperature__,
- increased __concentration__ of dissolved reactants, and increased __pressure__ of gaseous reactants,
- increased __surface area__ of solid reactants,
- use of a __catalyst__.

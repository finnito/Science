## The Rate of Reaction

Understanding the rate of reaction is very important in P큰taiao we need to be able to control it when performing reactions on an industrial scale.

> The rate at which __products are produced__.
> 
> OR
> 
> The rate at which __reactants are used up__.

Here are two ways we can measure the rate of reaction:

- measuring the volume of products produced,
- measuring the weight of reactants lost

Can you think of any others?

## Displacement of Gas {.c2}

Measuring the mililitres (mls) of gas produced over a period of time.

## Production of Gas Method {.c2}

When measuring the amount of gas produced, the volume goes up over time so the graph should look like this

## Loss of Mass Method {.c2}

When measuring the amount of mass lost, the mass goes down so the graph should look like this.

## Things to Note

- Sometimes a reaction will take a few seconds to start, this can be due to a protective coating on some metals.
- You need 4-5 iterations of your dependent variable (concentration, surface area, temperature) to draw a valid conclusion. Each iteration should be repeated at least three times so an average cna be calculated.

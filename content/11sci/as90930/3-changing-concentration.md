## Concentration: Collision Theory

- Concentration is easily thought of like raro - the more raro particles you add to your drink, the stronger it is!
- The more particles there are, the higher the chance there is of particles bumping into each other
- The more bumps there are, the greater number of collisions
- __It does not increase the probability of successful collisions__

---

### Tauria / Example

Say 10% of collisions result in a successful reaction between two particles.

If 1000 collisions happen, there should be $1000 \times 0.1 = 100$ successful reactions

Since concentration doesn't change the probability (10%), it only changes the number of collisions. $5000 \times 0.1 = 500$ successful reactions.

---

### Matapaki / Discussion

Why does changing the concentration __not__ change the probability of a successful reaction?

Think of the two things required for a reaction to occur!

---

#### Whakatika

Because it does not change:

- the __activation energy__,
- the energy of the particles (temperature/speed),
- or the likelihood that they collide in the correct orientation

---

## Dilutions

- To change the concentration we must dilute __one__ of our reactants.
- __P훮tai__: What do we dilute raro with?
- __Whakatika__: Water! $H_{2}O$
- __P훮tai__: Why do we dilute only one reactant?
- __Whakatika__: To ensure we are changing only one thing in our experiment so it is a fair test!

---

### Dilutions Explained

- In Year 11 we will do dilutions in percentages. For example, 90% $HCl$, 50% $HCl$ or 30% $HCl$
- For $10ml$ of 80% $HCl$ this means 80% of the $10ml$ is $HCl$ and 20% is water!

$\text{Volume} = \frac{percentage}{100} \times \text{total volume}$

### P훮tai: Calculate the volumes of each solution

$\text{Volume of Acid} = \frac{percentage}{100} \times \text{total volume}$

### Diagrams

Glue in the diagram and label each beaker with a concentration percentage. Red is acid and blue is water.

Re: <First> (11SCI)

<First> has been working diligently on the Chemical Investigation topic in Science for the past few weeks and the topic is coming to a close. <He> started a three-period practice assessment today. It will conclude on Friday. On Monday <he> will get feedback on <his> attempt and finish preparing for the final assessment starting next Tuesday.

The assessment next week is worth 4 Level 1 credits and only one assessment opportunity is available. Resubmissions are only available to those who get Not Achieved by a very slim margin. If you are away sick or have a calendared school event an extension will also be granted, you will just need to let me know so we can arrange how that will work.

Final Assessment: Tuesday 14 through Thursday 16.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns.

Mā te wā,

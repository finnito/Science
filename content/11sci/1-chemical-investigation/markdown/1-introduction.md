## The Rate of Reaction

Understanding the rate of reaction is very important in Science we need to be able to control it when performing reactions on an industrial scale.

It can be defined as the rate at which __products are produced__ OR __reactants are used up__.

Here are two ways we can measure the rate of reaction:

- measuring the volume of products produced,
- measuring the weight of reactants lost

Can you think of any others?

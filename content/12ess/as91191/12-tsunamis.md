### Recap

Any movement on the ocean floor displaces the water above it and launches huge rolling waves of energy that will become a tsunami.

This movement can be caused by:

- Earthquakes 
- Volcanic eruptions 
- Submarine avalanches 

A tsunami can also be caused by landslides. Landslides occur when large amounts of rock are displaced and fall into the ocean.

---

As tsunami waves approach shore lines and enter shallower water, they slow down and begin to grow in height. This is called shoaling.

### Submarine Avalanches {.c2}

- When an underwater avalanche (landslip) occurs, the force of the slip causes water to be dragged in a downward direction 
- This results in it being rapidly drawn in an upwards direction, like a spring, and the energy is released as a tsunami wave

### Landslides

- A landslide is a movement of rock, sediment and vegetation caused by seismic shaking or slope instability
- When land is suddenly displaced, and enters the water, it generates a lot of energy
- This energy is transferred to kinetic energy in the water, which  can cause a large tsunami

- Land that is displaced from higher up has more gravitational potential energy. When it is displaced it converts this into kinetic energy. 
- If there are cliffs restricting water, such as in a fiord, the water that is displaced cannot disperse energy in a horizontal direction. Instead it moves upwards, damaging the surrounding cliff.  
- The larger the mass of displaced rock, the larger the wave 
- The higher the the rock has to fall, the larger the resulting wave because it has converted more energy

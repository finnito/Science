## Homework/Revision Cycle

The homework cycle comes in three steps, and after completing the 3rd, you simply go back to step one and repeat.

1. __Attempt the Question__
    - Use your notes/hints,
    - ask a friend,
    - ask your teacher for help.
2. __Grade__
    - Use the marking schedule to check your work,
    - give yourself a __N/A/M/E__ grade,
    - underline correct responses, and circle incorrect ones that need improving.
3. __Corrections__
    - Go back to your notes and correct the circled points,
    - make a list of key points to remember next time you do this type of question,
    - __don't just copy out the answer scheme!__

## Exam Format

This page compiles __all__ past exam questions from 2012-2020. The exam comes in a very reliable format - three long answer questions.

1. Volcano + Hazards
2. Earthquakes + Fault Lines
3. Tsunamis + Energy

The usual cut scores for an entire exam are:

1. 0-6: Not Achieved
2. 7-12: Achieved
3. 13-18: Merit
4. 19-24: Excellence

### Diagrams

Most questions also indicate "_[a] diagram may assist your answer_", and this is backed up by moderator comments. __Diagrams help you get better marks!__

>  "Candidates who created and annotated diagrams to support their answers showed a deeper understanding of the questions that those who did not" - [2015 Assessment Report](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/reports/2015/level2/science.pdf)

### Laying out Answers

The most recent exam questions have been divided up into chunks, to allow for more scaffolded answers. However, you should not rely on this occurring. To write an answer, first read the question in depth and scribble a short list of topics that you need to write about.

- Write a paragraph for each heading
- Include the heading at the top of the paragraph
- Cross off what the question suggests you write about, as you go.

### Student Skills

The [2015 Assessment Report](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/reports/2015/level2/science.pdf) also indicates the skills that students had for each __N/A/M/E__ grade. These skills can also be thought of as extra learning outcomes/_whāinga ako_ in your revision.

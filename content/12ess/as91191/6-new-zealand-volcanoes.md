## Volcanoes in New Zealand {.c2}

![[Source](https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/113614361/a-volcanic-eruption-in-auckland-how-to-prepare)](https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/h/m/0/f/c/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.710x400.1vn5eh.png/1560921535247.jpg)

- The type of volcano which forms depends on the __magma type__
- The __viscosity__ of the magma largely dictates the shape of the volcano

---

### {.c2}

- There are four main types of volcanoes in New Zealand:
    + Shield volcanoes
    + Caldera volcanoes
    + Lava dome volcanoes
    + Composite cones (stratovolcanos)

### Shield Volcanoes (Basalt) {.c2}

- The flattish gently sloping __shield volcanoes__ of DUnedin and Christchurch are built from basalt
- The Dunedin volcano was active 10-13MYA, and the Lyttelton/Akaroa volcanoes 5.8-13MYA
- The form because low viscosity lava can flow a great distance before solidifying into solid rock

---

- Built of silica-poor basalt magma
- Magma comes from the mantle, about 100km deep - the _hot spot_. But they can also be formed by subduction sometimes.
- The magma has very little water or dissolved gas, so eruptions are very gentle.
- Eruptions are also gentle because the magma is runny and very hot, therefore it travels a long way before cooling. Therefore the volcanoes build up with very gentle slopes.

---

## Caldera and Dome Volcanoes

- Formed from viscous rhyolitic magma which is very viscous because it has a high amount of silica. 
- Gas, especially water vapour and carbon dioxide from melted carbonates, gets trapped in the sticky lava which results in very explosive eruptions forming calderas.
- Sometimes the gas escapes so that the magma is still very sticky without trapped gas. This forms dome volcanoes.

### Calera Volcanoes (Rhyolite) {.c2}

- Some volcanoes are very wide flat areas which complete collapsed following huge eruptions to form __calderas__ (e.g. Lake Taupō).
- The eruption would have been extremely large and violent.
- Taupō last erupted about 186AD.

---

### Dome Volcanoes {.c2}

- Mt Tarawera also formed through sticky magma being pushed upwards very slowly.
- This upward pressure is due to gas.

## Cone Volcanoes (Andesite) {.c2}

- Steep cone volcanoes like Mt Taranake and Mt Ruapehu are formed when alternating layers of slightly sticky andesite lava and ash build up a cone around the vent.

---

- Typically formed at subduction zones
- Made up of andesitic lava which has an intermediate amount of silica
- The lava is semi-sticky and cooler. This means that it is so runny and that it cools more quickly.
- The combination of these two factors means that it does not travel as far and forms cone shapes.
- Eruptions can be gentle, erupting lava, or explosive, eruption hot ash.

### Rangahau/Research

1. Cut out each of the images of the NZ volcanoes. Glue into your book and label - 2 per page 
2. Next to/underneath your images, write: 

- A description of the general shape of this volcano
- How it forms 
- The magma type
- The typical products of the eruptions this volcano has 
- Any special features this type of volcano has 
- Other examples in NZ

## Earthquakes {.c2}

- __Recall__: Earth is made up of tectonic plates which move past each other
- __Recall__: New Zealand sits on the _Ring of Fire_
- __Recall__: Most earthquakes occur on this ring of tectonic plates

### What Causes Earthquakes {.c2}

- Tectonic plates cannot move smoothly past each other <mark>due to high friction</mark>
- Tectonic <mark>plates move suddenly</mark>
- This sudden movement is a <mark>large release of energy</mark>

- Energy moves through the ground as <mark>seismic waves</mark>
- The point under the ground where the plates actually move is called the __focus__
- The point on the surface, directly above the _focus_ is called the __epicenter__

### Pﾄ》ai: What Causes Earthquakes?

There are two ways that earthquakes occur in New Zealand:

1. Through __volcanic activity__ (breaking of rocks through mantle pressure)
2. __Tectonic plate movement__ due to the movement of the mantle

<mark>It all comes back to the mantle!</mark>

### Pﾄ》ai: How to Plates Move?

1. Crust is being pulled apart. The land slumps downwards and away from the other block.
2. The two blocks are driven together, one block climbs above another.
3. Block move sideways past each other.

<p class="instruction">Sketch the diagrams & descriptions in your book.</p>

### Task/Ngohe

Put these steps in order in your book!

- When the stress becomes too high, the block suddenly moves to a new position in just a few seconds.
- Stress (elastic potential energy) builds up in the blocks of the rock.
- Fault lines form both close and faraway from the stress to relives some of this pressure.
- Blocks of rock on either side of a fault are stuck together, but tectonic plates (Pacific and Australian) are still moving slowly.
- Energy is released in the form of seismic waves. We feel this as an earthquake.

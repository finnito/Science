## Auckland Volcanic Field {.c2}

- The Auckland Volcanic Field is made up of over 50 separate volcanoes scattered across New Zealand's largest city. It is an area of about 360 km2 
- During the 250,000 years, Auckland’s volcanoes have totally changed the landscape. Volcanoes in Auckland include small cones less than 150 m in height and explosion craters.

- The AVF is made up of around <mark>53 hotspot volcanoes</mark> of various sizes and ages.
- Remember <mark>hotspot volcanoes are made up of basaltic lava</mark>. They usually only <mark>usually erupt once</mark>.
- The type of volcanic activity in Auckland means each eruption has occurred at a new location; these are coming from a single active ‘hot spot' of magma about 100 km below the city. Many of the volcanoes today have been quarried or become public parks. 
- Auckland’s existing volcanoes are <mark>unlikely to become active again</mark>, but the Auckland Volcanic Field itself is young and still active. Any <mark>new explosions would occur from entirely new vents</mark>

### Rangitoto {.c2}

- The most recent eruption occurred around <mark>600 years ago at Rangitoto</mark>
- Of all Auckland’s eruptions, <mark>Rangitoto was the only one witnessed by people</mark>.
- The eruption would have been <mark>extremely violent, as the lava came into contact with sea water</mark>.
- Rangitoto alone <mark>produced a volume of lava equal to that erupted by the rest of the volcanoes in the volcanic field</mark>.

### Risks of the AVF {.c2}

- Auckland is <mark>vulnerable to ash fall</mark> from other North Island volcanoes. As Auckland provides over 1/3 of the nation’s gross domestic product, is a major transport and economic hub, and is home to over 1.6 million people, a <mark>volcanic eruption would place the nation’s economy and the city’s infrastructure and population at risk</mark>.
- DEVORA project (Determining Volcanic Risk in Auckland) is working on a 7 year project around the risks of the AVF

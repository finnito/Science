## Akoranga 18 Mahi Tuatahi

1. Outline why earthquakes occur.
2. Explain what prevents tectonic plates from moving in a smooth, constant manner.
3. Define the term _fault_.
4. Explain the difference between an earthquake's _focus_ and _epicenter_.
5. What happens to wet, loose soil during an earthquake?

### Whakatika

1. __Outline why earthquakes occur.__<br>Earthquakes occur when two or more tectonic plates move against each other.
2. __Explain what prevents tectonic plates from moving in a smooth, constant manner.__<br>Friction between the two plates prevents constant movement.
3. __Define the term _fault_.__<br>A crack in the Earth's crust due to TP movement
4. __Explain the difference between an earthquake's _focus_ and _epicenter_.__<br>The focus is the place underground where the earthquake occurs. The epicenter is on the surface directly above the focus.
5. __What happens to wet, loose soil during an earthquake?__<br>Liquefaction

### {.c2}

The Pacific and Australian Plates are locked together in the South Island along the Alpine Fault. These two plates are pushing into each other in a transform (right-lateral strikeslip) fault – this is a major 600 km transform fault, which also causes uplift, forming the Southern Alps.

Elastic potential energy builds up over a period of time, and eventually the rock cannot withstand any more strain. This is due to the fault moving $30mm$ per year. The energy is released as the plates move, releasing a huge amount of energy in an earthquake.

---

## Fault Lines

- Fault lines are <mark>cracks in the Earth’s crust often at plate boundaries</mark> - but not always
- There are also many <mark>smaller fault lines where small movements have occurred</mark>.
- E.g. the Malborough fault system

### {.c2}

- Earthquakes deep under the North Island tell us exactly where the two plates are rubbing together.
- The melted rock rises up again in volcanic eruptions.

## Earthquake Waves

Three types of waves move through Earth's surface when an earthquake occurs

### P-Waves

Also known as __primary waves__ are the <mark>first waves to hit</mark> as they <mark>move the fastest ($8kms^{-1}$)</mark>.  They squeeze and stretch the rock.

---

### S-Waves

Also known as __secondary waves__.  These waves <mark>move at $5kms^{-1}$</mark> and make the ground <mark>shake up and down as well as from side to side</mark>.

### L-Waves

Travelling at <mark>$4kms^{-1}$</mark> are the <mark>last waves to hit</mark>.  These waves <mark>do the most damage as they travel near the surface of the crust</mark>.

## Measuring Earthquakes

Earthquakes are measured on two different scales:

- __The Richter Scale__ - This measures the amount of energy released in an earthquake, using a seismograph. It is a 10 step scale - each whole number jump has around 32x more energy released
- __The Mercalli Scale__ - This measures the effect on people and the environment at the surface of the quake. It is on a 12 point scale 

---

### Mercalli Scale

Earthquake intensity is determined using:

1. Strength of earthquake
2. Distance from epicenter
3. Nature of surface materials
4. Building design

The Mercalli scale does not give a true indication of the actual strength of an earthquake because the amount of damage done to different places will largely depend on the type of materials used and the degree of construction of buildings and structures.

### Richter Scale {.c2}

- Measures __magnitude__ of an earthquake on a 10-point scale
- Richter magnitude is determined by measuring the largest amplitude (wave height) recorded on a seismogram.
- Each increase in 1 in Richter Magnitude represents a 30 fold increase in the energy released (size). A magnitude 8 earthquake releases $30 \times 30 = 900$ times more energy than a magnitude 6 earthquake.

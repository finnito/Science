## The Exam

- 3 essay-style long answer questions
- 3 topics, one question on each:
    + Volcanoes
    + Earthquakes
    + Tsunamis
- You have plenty of room, so can plan your answers!

---

### Breaking Down a Question

- <mark>Start questions on volcanoes & earthquakes with a brief explanation of plate tectonics & convection currents.</mark>
    + Basic Earth structure
    + Crust structure
    + Convection currents
    + (Briefly) Wegner's theory of continental drift

---

#### Suggested Topics

- Each question comes with a series of bullet points outlining what you __should__ include in your answer.
- <mark>Each of these bullet points should be a whole paragraph in your answer.</mark>
- A diagram is always suggested, and <mark>students who include diagrams typically get better grades.</mark>

---

#### Planning

- Title each paragraph of your answer
- Include a series of bullet points below to outline your answer (for your benefit):

__1. Tectonic Plates & Convection Currents__

- Basic Earth structure
- Crust structure
- Convection currents
- (Briefly) Wegner's theory of continental drift

#### 2019 Q1 Bullet 1

__2. Mantle-Crust Interaction & Volcano Formation__

- Plate boundary, Pacific plate subducting under Australian
- Melting of plate
- Hot spot: plume of magma is rising
- Outer core is heating the mantle, causing it to rise
- Crust is stretching, becoming thin, cracks for volcanoes to form in

#### 2019 Q1 Bullet 2

__3. Magma Type & Characteristics__

- [Basaltic/Andesitic/Rhyolitic] magma
- Viscosity (impact on eruption)
- Silica content (impact on eruption)
- Gas content (impact on eruption)
- Water content (impact on eruption)

#### 2019 Q1 Bullet 3

__4. Eruption Stages & Landscape Features__

- Describe the field
- Shape of volcanoes
- Frequency of eruption
- Number of volcanoes (why)
- How the volcanoes erupt (violent, or more peacefully etc.)

### Whakatika

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred or transformed.

## Pātai: Describe These Transformations

1. Miles is playing football and kicks the ball into the air upfield to a striker.
2. Toby gets up in the morning to go for a run. He eats three Weet-Bix before he goes.
3. Phoenix goes bungee jumping near Wanaka.

<p class="instruction">Write the answers in paris, in your book.</p>

---

### Whakatika

1. Kinetic (foot) --> elastic + sound + heat --> kinetic + gravitational (ball) --> kinetic + sound + heat + pontential as the striker catches the ball.
2. Chemical --> potential + kinetic as he gets up --> kinetic as he runs
3. Potential --> kinetic --> elastic potential at the bottom

## Pātai: Energy in Meteors {.c2}

What energy transformations do meteoroids undergo as they fall towards and onto a planet/moon?

![[Source](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-02/fyi-do-meteor-showers-ever-run-out-meteors/)](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c6/c7/de/c6c7de92139d14423d29874f0474e6f2.jpg)

- In space they have gravitational potential & kinetic energy
- As they fall, gravitational potential energy is transformed into more kinetic energy
- Some of this kinetic energy is dissipated as heat/light/sound as it impacts the atmosphere

## Pātai {.c2}

What happens to the rest of the kinetic energy if the meteor doesn't completely break up in the atmosphere?

The kinetic energy is transferred into the ground, creating an impact crater and throwing out debris!

## Gravitational Potential Energy / _Pūngao tō ā-papa_

> The potential an object has to fall in a gravitational field.

\begin{aligned}
    E_{p} &= mass \times gravity \times height \newline
    E_{p} &= m \times g \times h
\end{aligned}

<p class="instruction">Pātai: What can we change about a meteoroid to give it more gravitational potential energy?</p>

---

### Whakatika {.c2}

1. Increase its mass
2. Increase its height (distance away from Earth) in the gravitational field

## Kinetic Energy / _Pūngao Neke_

> Energy an object in motion has

\begin{aligned}
    Energy &= \frac{1}{2} mass \times velocity^{2} \newline
    E &= \frac{1}{2}m \times v^{2}
\end{aligned}

<p class="instruction">Pātai: What can we change about a meteorite to give it more kinetic energy?</p>

---

### Whakatika

1. Increase its mass!

\begin{aligned}
    E &= \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{2} &&= 500J \newline
    E &= \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times 10^{2} &&= 1,000J
\end{aligned}

2. Increase its velocity (has a greater effect)!

\begin{aligned}
    E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{2} = 500J \newline
    E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 15^{2} = 1,125J
\end{aligned}

## Akoranga 5 Mahi Tuatahi

1. Brainstorm some characteristics of a crater that could change depending on the energy of the impact?

---

### Whakatika

- Crater depth
- Crater width
- Amount/volume of debris ejected
- Distance that debris is ejected

---

## Conservation of Energy

Typically to increase the energy of an impact in a simulation we increase the height that it is dropped from, thereby giving it more gravitational potential energy to be converted to kinetic energy (increasing its impact velocity).

\begin{aligned}
    E_{p} &= E_{k} \newline
    m \times g \times h &= \frac{1}{2}m \times v^{2} && \text{Mass cancels out} \newline
    g \times h &= \frac{1}{2} \times v^{2} && \text{Re-arrange for v} \newline
        2 \times g \times h &= v^{2} \newline
    \sqrt{2 \times g \times h} &= v
\end{aligned}

### Theoretical vs Real-World {.c2}

\begin{aligned}
    v = \sqrt{2 \times g \times h}
\end{aligned}

![[Source](https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/nwa-4420-meteorite)](https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/105/585de2c5636a3c34a9a706bd61e447b3.jpg)

- This gives the _theoretical_ impact velocity of a rock dropped within Earth's gravitational field.
- __Pātai__: What assumption are we making here?
- __Whakatika__: That energy is conserved
- __Pātai__: What happens to some of that energy?
- __Whakatika__: That some energy is lost to the atmosphere as light/heat/sound.
- __Whakakapi/Conclusion__: Real-world velocity is less than the theoretical maximum velocity.

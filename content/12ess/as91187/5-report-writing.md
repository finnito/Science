## The Aim

> What is the objective of your experiment?

An aim describes what you will be investigating e.g. "The aim of this experiment is to investigate the relationship between ____ and ___."

---

## The Hypothesis

> A prediction for the outcome of the experiment

A hypothesis should make a __specific__ and __testable__ prediction about the outcome of your experiment. Remember, you should change only one variable, but you can _measure_ more than one variable. 

E.g. I think that _______ will [increase/decrease] when the ______ is [increased/descreased].
    
---

## Variables

> __Independent Variable__: The variable that you will change.

Be specific about your description and units. E.g. We will change the concentration of the $HCl$ measured in $mol$.

---

> __Dependent Variable(s)__: The variable(s) being measured.

You _can_ measure multiple variables, but generally only measure one. Be specific about what you will measure and the units the measurement will be gathered in.

E.g We will measure the time taken to produce $10ml$ of carbon dioxide gas.

---

> __Control Variable(s)__: Things that you are keeping __constant__ in between trials.

E.g. The concentration of the $HCl$ used, the volume of $HCl$ used, the test tube used, the timer used, the same person using the timer

---

## Method

- At the top, give an equipment list,
- give you method as a numbered list,
- break things up into small steps and say when you repeat a set of steps,
- each step should be short and concise, and should explain such what someone with no knowledge of the experiment could do it.

## Reliability and Validity

|                            |                                                       Reliability                                                        |                                                     Validity                                                     |

| __What does it tell you?__ | The extent to which the __results can be reproduced__ when the research is repeated under the same conditions.           | The extent to which the results really measure what they are supposed to measure.                                |

|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| __How is it assessed?__    | By checking the __consistency of results__ across time, across different observers, and across parts of the test itself. | By checking __how well the results correspond to established theories__ and other measures of the same concept.  |

| __How do they relate?__    | __A reliable measurement is not always valid__: the results might be reproducible, but they’re not necessarily correct.  | __A valid measurement is generally reliable__: if a test produces accurate results, they should be reproducible. |

## Data/Results

- Design a table to record your results __before__ you start the whakamātau,
- You will need to think about how many trials you are going to do, how many measurements you will make and calculating an average.
- You may also wish to create a graph to display/help interpret your results

---

|             | Trial 1 | Trial 2 | Trial 3 | Average |
|:------------|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| Powder      |         |         |         |         |
| Small Chips |         |         |         |         |
| Large Chips |         |         |         |         |

__Average__: Add up all your trials and divide by the number of trials.

## Conclusion

- Link your aim and hypothesis to thedata you gathered.
- In our whakamātau we investigated __[your-aim-here]__ and we found that when the __[temperature/surface area/concentration]__ was __[increased/decreased]__ that the reaction went __[slower/faster]__. This tells us that the rate of reaction __[increased/decreased]__. This is reflected in our results, for example __[two-pieces-of-data-compared-here]__. This [supports/does not support] our hypothesis that ____.

## Discussion/Evaluation

- Discuss the reliability of your data
- Discuss the validity of your method
- Discuss any mistakes that were made
- Discuss improvements/changes to your method that were made
- Discuss what your findings suggest about what you are modelling

## The Aim

> What is the objective of your experiment?

An aim describes what you will be investigating (the purpose of the experiment). Keep it simple, one sentence long.

> e.g. The aim of this experiment is to investigate the relationship between [_your independent variable here_] and [_your dependent variable here_].

---

## The Hypothesis

> A prediction for the outcome of the experiment.

A hypothesis should make a __specific__ and __testable__ prediction about the outcome of your experiment. It must make a prediction about the effect of your _independent variable_ on your _dependent variable_.

Remember, you can only have one independent variable, but you can _measure_ more than one variable.

> e.g. I think that [_your dependent variable here_] will [_increase/decrease_] when the [_your independent variable here_] is [increased/descreased].
    
---

## Independent Variable

> The variable that you will change throughout the experiment.

Be specific about what _exactly_ you are changing. For example, you may be investigating how the impact velocity changes a crater __by changing the drop height to alter the velocity__.

You should include units of measurement for the independent variable, as well as the 3-5 different increments that you want to use.

> e.g. We will change the mass of the projectile (measured in kgs). We will use 0.25kg, 0.5kg, 0.75kg, 1kg and 2kg masses.

---

## Dependent Variable

> The variable(s) being measured.

You _can_ measure multiple variables, but your report will be easier to write if you only measure one.

Be specific about what you will measure and the units of measurement of the dependent variable.

> e.g. We will measure the time taken to produce $10ml$ of carbon dioxide gas.

---

## Control Variables

> Things that you are keeping __constant__ in between trials.

Control variables are extremely important because they are what keep a trial fair and let you __draw a causal relationship between your independent and dependent variable__. Without control variables you cannot say for sure what the influence of your independent variable was.

Include __at least four control variables__ in your report and __explain how you will control them__.

[Examples](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/control-variable/) 

---

## Method

> A prodecural set of steps that a Scientist can follow to perform an experiment.

A method should be a sequential set of steps that any person could follow to perform the exact same experiment.

- Give a list of necessary equipment (be specific)
- Use numbered, short, steps
- Give the actions / directions in the past tense or passive voice
	+ "The shotput was dropped from a height of 1m onto the tray of sand."
- Some steps may be repeated while the independent variable is changed.
	+ "Repeat steps 3-7 for each height"
- Indicate when something is to be recorded and how to calculate the relevant average.

---

## Data + Results

- Design a table to record your results __before__ you start the experiment/whakamātau.
- Think about how many trials you will do + an average.
- Also make a note of anything unusual that occurred during your experiment, or if anything went wrong etc.

## Calculations

- When calculating an average, you should give an example of how you did it so that another Scientist can see the process.
- If you are calculating impact velocity (due to changing height), for example, you should give an example of how you did that calculation.

__Calculating an Average__: Add up all your trials and divide by the number of trials.

---

## Graphs {.c2}

- You should also create a graph to help interpret your results.
- A graph should have the following:
	+ A title
	+ X and Y axis labels + units
	+ Data points indicated with crosses
	+ A smoooth line of best fit
	+ __DO NOT JOIN THE DOTS__
	+ X and Y axes starting at zero
	+ Even scale on the X and Y axes

## Conclusion

- Link your aim and hypothesis to the data you gathered.
- Summarise your data by stating the trend.
- Give an example comparison of two data points.
- Explain whether this supported your hypothesis or not and whether you achieved your aim.

> e.g. In our whakamātau we investigated [_your aim here_] and we found that when [_your data summary here_]. This is reflected in our data, for example [_your example data here_]. This [_supports/does not support_] our hypothesis that [_your hypothesis here_].

---

## Discussion/Evaluation

- Discuss any mistakes that were made (past tense)
- Discuss improvements/changes to your method that were made (past tense)
- Discuss future improvements that could be made to your method
- Discuss the reliability of your data
- Discuss the validity of your method
- Discuss what your findings suggest about what you are modelling - this is where you bring in some __Science and research!__.

---

## Reliability

- __What does it tell you?__ The extent to which the __results can be reproduced__ when the research is repeated under the same conditions.
- __How is it assessed?__ By checking the __consistency of results__ across time, across different observers, and across parts of the test itself.
- __How does it relate to validity?__ A reliable measurement is not always valid: the results might be reproducible, but they’re not necessarily correct.

> e.g. Looking at our results we can see that they are all similar to each other. This means that our dependent variable is well controlled. These results should therefore be reproducible by other scientists. However, this does not indicate that these results are _correct_.

---

## Validity

- __What does it tell you?__ The extent to which the results really measure what they are supposed to measure.
- __How is it assessed?__ By checking __how well the results correspond to established theories__ and other measures of the same concept.
- __How does it relate to validity?__ A valid measurement is generally reliable: if a test produces accurate results, they should be reproducible.

> e.g. Research shows that past experiments and theories indicate that an increase in impact velocity will result in a large diameter impact crater. Our data shows the same trend. This indicates that our experiment is sufficiently controlled and that we are _actually_ measuring the influence of [_your independent variable_] on [_your depenedent variable_].

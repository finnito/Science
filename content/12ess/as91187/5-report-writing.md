## Spellcheck & Proof Read

1. Run a spellchecker on your report!
2. Put your report in Grammarly.

---

## Logbook

- A logbook is __required__ to pass the assessment
- Include all contributions from each of your group members on each day you worked on the assessment

---

## References

- A list of references is required to pass the assessment
- You may reference the notes made by your teacher
- Without a list of references you could have made up or copied your report. This is cheating.
- Copying whole paragraphs from the internet to use in your report is plagarism (cheating), and will result in a __NA__ and further consequences.
- References should be APA formatted. You can do this by using https://www.citethisforme.com.

## The Aim

> What is the objective of your experiment?

An aim describes what you will be investigating (the purpose of the experiment). Keep it simple, one sentence long.

> e.g. The aim of this experiment is to investigate the relationship between [_your independent variable here_] and [_your dependent variable here_].

---

## The Hypothesis

> A prediction for the outcome of the experiment.

- A hypothesis should make a __specific__ and __testable__ prediction about the outcome of your experiment. It must make a prediction about the effect of your _independent variable_ on your _dependent variable_.
- Remember, you can only have one independent variable, but you can _measure_ more than one variable.

> e.g. I think that [_your dependent variable here_] will [_increase/decrease_] when the [_your independent variable here_] is [increased/descreased].
    
---

## Independent Variable

> The variable that you will change throughout the experiment.

- Be specific about what _exactly_ you are changing. For example, you may be investigating how the impact velocity changes a crater __by changing the drop height to alter the velocity__.
- You should include units of measurement for the independent variable, as well as the 3-5 different increments that you want to use.
- Remember, if you are changing the _height_ you drop your impactor from, you independent variable is actually the _velocity_.

> e.g. We will change the mass of the projectile (measured in kgs). We will use 0.25kg, 0.5kg, 0.75kg, 1kg and 2kg masses.

---

## Dependent Variable

> The variable(s) being measured.

You _can_ measure multiple variables, but your report will be easier to write if you only measure one.

Be specific about what you will measure and the units of measurement of the dependent variable.

> e.g. We will measure the time taken to produce $10ml$ of carbon dioxide gas.

---

## Control Variables

> Things that you are keeping __constant__ in between trials.

Control variables are extremely important because they are what keep a trial fair and let you __draw a causal relationship between your independent and dependent variable__. Without control variables you cannot say for sure what the influence of your independent variable was.

Include __at least four control variables__ in your report and __explain how you will control them__.

[Examples](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/control-variable/) 

---

## Method

> A method should be a sequential set of steps that any person could follow to perform the exact same experiment.

- Give a list of necessary equipment (be specific)
- Use numbered, short, steps
- Give the actions / directions in the past tense or passive voice
	+ "The shotput was dropped from a height of 1m onto the tray of sand."
- Some steps may be repeated while the independent variable is changed.
	+ "Repeat steps 3-7 for each height (0.5m, 1m, 1.5m, 2m, 5m)"
- Indicate when something is to be recorded and how to calculate the relevant average.
- Indicate how an experiment should be reset between trials and when to apply control variables.

---

## Data + Results

- Design a table to record your results __before__ you start the experiment/whakamātau.
- Think about how many trials you will do + an average.
- Also make a note of anything unusual that occurred during your experiment, or if anything went wrong etc.

A table might look something like this:
<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-7btt{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-fymr{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">

    <td class="tg-fymr">Trial 2</td>

  </tr>

</table>

## Calculations

- When calculating an average, you should give an example of how you did it so that another Scientist can see the process.
- If you are calculating __impact velocity (due to changing height)__, for example, you should give an example of how you did that calculation. We did this derivation in class!

__Calculating an Average__: Add up all your trials and divide by the number of trials.

---

## Graphs {.c2}

- You should also create a graph to help interpret your results.
- You can draw the graph by hand or produce it on Google Sheets / Excel.
- A graph should have the following:
  + Independent (thing you are changing) on the x-axis
  + Dependent (thing you are measuring) on the y-axis
  + __Plot the averages__
	+ A title
	+ X and Y axis labels + units
	+ Data points indicated with crosses
	+ A smoooth line of best fit
	+ __DO NOT JOIN THE DOTS__
	+ X and Y axes starting at zero
	+ Even scale on the X and Y axes

## Conclusion

- Link your aim and hypothesis to the data you gathered.
- Summarise your data by stating the trend.
- Give an example comparison of two data points.
- Explain whether this supported your hypothesis or not and whether you achieved your aim.

> e.g. In our whakamātau we investigated [_your aim here_] and we found that when [_your data summary here_]. This is reflected in our data, for example [_your example data here_]. This [_supports/does not support_] our hypothesis that [_your hypothesis here_].

---

## Discussion/Evaluation

- Discuss any mistakes that were made (past tense)
- Discuss improvements/changes to your method that were made (past tense)
- Discuss future improvements that could be made to your method
- Discuss the reliability of your data
- Discuss the validity of your method
- Discuss what your findings suggest about what you are modelling - this is where you bring in some __Science and research!__.

---

## Reliability

- __What does it tell you?__ The extent to which the __results can be reproduced__ when the research is repeated under the same conditions.
- __How is it assessed?__ By checking the __consistency of results__ between each trial of the increments of the independent variable.
- __How does it relate to validity?__ A reliable measurement is not always valid: the results might be reproducible, but they’re not necessarily correct.

> e.g. Looking at our results we can see that each trial of the different increments of our independent variable are similar to each other. This means that our dependent variable is well controlled. These results should therefore be reproducible by other scientists. However, this does not indicate that these results are _correct or valid_.

<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky"></th>
    <th class="tg-7btt" colspan="4">Radius of Impact Crater (m)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Mass of Impactor</td>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Trial 2</td>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Trial 2</td>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Trial 3</td>
    <td class="tg-fymr">Average</td>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-fymr">0.25kg</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">0.07</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">0.08</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">0.07</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">0.06</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-fymr">0.50kg</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">0.12</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">0.05</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">0.20</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">0.015</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-fymr">0.75kg</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-fymr">1.00kg</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-fymr">2.00kg</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For the above table:

- The 0.25kg trials __look quite reliable__ because they are all __similar__
- The 0.5kg trials __do not look very reliable__ because there is a __wide variety__ in the diameters

If you are getting a wide variety in results, you may need to re-work your method by adding further control variables or clearer instructions so the results are closer together.

---

## Validity

- __What does it tell you?__ The extent to which the results really measure what they are supposed to measure (model vs real world).
- __How is it assessed?__ By checking __how well the results correspond to established theories__ and other measures of the same concept. Do your results match previous research?
- __How does it relate to reliability?__ A valid measurement is generally reliable: if a test produces accurate results, they should be reproducible.

> e.g. Research shows that past experiments and theories indicate that an increase in impact velocity will result in a large diameter impact crater. Our data shows the same trend. This indicates that our experiment is sufficiently controlled and that we are _actually_ measuring the influence of [_your independent variable_] on [_your depenedent variable_].

Tēnā koe,

My name is Finn Le Sueur and I will be <First Name>'s teacher for Year 12 Earth and Space Science this year. Attached to this email is an outline for the year, although it should be noted that the dates could be subject to change as the year progresses.

Internals:
- Practical Investigation (4 credits)
- Local Geology (4 credits)
- Extreme Environments (4 credits)

Externals:
- Life of Stars and Planetary Systems (4 credits)
- Extreme Earth Events (4 credits)

The content for the year is wide and varied and I hope that <First Name> enjoys themselves and learns a lot this year.

I will do my best to contact home when certain assessment dates are near, but please do not hesitate to be in contact if you have any questions or concerns throughout the year.

Thank you for your support of <First Name>!

Mā te wā,
Finn Le Sueur

## Homework/Revision Cycle

The homework cycle comes in three steps, and after completing the 3rd, you simply go back to step one and repeat.

1. __Attempt the Question__
    - Use your notes/hints,
    - ask a friend,
    - ask your teacher for help.
2. __Grade__
    - Use the marking schedule to check your work,
    - give yourself a __N/A/M/E__ grade,
    - underline correct responses, and circle incorrect ones that need improving.
3. __Corrections__
    - Go back to your notes and correct the circled points,
    - make a list of key points to remember next time you do this type of question,
    - __don't just copy out the answer scheme!__

## Exam Format

This page compiles __all__ past exam questions from 2012-2020. The exam comes in a very reliable format - three long answer questions.

1. Interpreting Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams
2. Stellar life cycles
3. Planet/moon formation

The usual cut scores for an entire exam are:

1. 0-6: Not Achieved
2. 7-12: Achieved
3. 13-18: Merit
4. 19-24: Excellence

### Diagrams

Most questions also indicate "_[a] diagram may assist your answer_", and this is backed up by moderator comments. __Diagrams help you get better marks!__

>  "Candidates who created and annotated diagrams to support their answers showed a deeper understanding of the questions that those who did not" - [2015 Assessment Report](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/reports/2015/level2/science.pdf)

### Laying out Answers

The most recent exam questions have been divided up into chunks, to allow for more scaffolded answers. However, you should not rely on this occurring. To write an answer, first read the question in depth and scribble a short list of topics that you need to write about.

- Write a paragraph for each heading
- Include the heading at the top of the paragraph
- Cross off what the question suggests you write about, as you go.

### Student Skills

The [2015 Assessment Report](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/reports/2015/level2/science.pdf) also indicates the skills that students had for each __N/A/M/E__ grade. These skills can also be thought of as extra learning outcomes/_whāinga ako_ in your revision.

<details>
    <summary>Not Achieved</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>could not describe characteristics of stars from the HR diagram,</li>
        <li>referred only to either inner or outer planets</li>
        <li>only described part of the life cycle of a large mass star.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Achieved</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>described general star characteristics from the HR Diagram and inferred the size of the stars; some were linking large size to increased luminosity / brightness,</li>
        <li>gave the material of the inner and outer planets,</li>
        <li>described the key stages of the life cycle of a large mass star.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Merit</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>linked increased / decreased luminosity to the surface area of one OR both stars,</li>
        <li>explained how inner and / or outer planets formed in reference to two clear points
(often material and temperature),</li>
        <li>were able to discuss the life cycle of a massive star with explanations of two
stages with regards to fuel use, gravity and mass.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Excellence</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>made the clear link between same temperature and different brightness due to different surface areas emitting the same energy,</li>
        <li>explained the formation of inner and outer planets with reasons with regards to the example, rather than our solar system</li>
        <li>explained in detail the birth, life and death of a large mass star that had links to mass, energy changes, gravity and fuel use.</li>
    </ul>

## Whātata Whakaata / The Telescope {.c2}

- Last year we were fortunate enough to have a telescope funded in part by the Science Department, and in part by the whānau of Cashmere High
- We are using this telescope to support in the education of our Y12 and Y13 Earth and Space students, as well as making it available for our juniors in the Y9 Space unit!
- Tonight is its inaugural outing
- __Pātai__: Who has used a telescope before?
- __Pātai__: Who has seen a lunar eclipse before?

### How it Works {.c2}

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1935/4371/files/Reflector_Diagram_9a99023b-651d-4295-b332-66aa0fd6320f_1024x1024.jpg?v=1582681176)

1. Light enters the top of the telescope
2. It is reflected off the primary (large) mirror at the base of the telescope
3. It is then re-directed by a secondary mirror and focussed through a series of lenses for your viewing pleasure through the eyepiece

### Using the Telescope {.c2}

- It rotates on a circular base, and is tilted simply up and down
- Your face should touch the rubber around the eyepiece 
- Focus can be adjusted using coarse (large) and fine (small) control knobs on the eyepiece
- Try not to knock the telescope as it is easily jostled and might be to be re-directed

## Pōunga / Lunar Eclipses

- __Pātai__: Does anyone know how a lunar eclipse works?
- __Whakatika__:
    + The Earth-Moon-Sun system form a line, such that Earth casts a shadow on the moon!

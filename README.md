## What is This?

This repository serves a Gitlab Pages site which contains and displays all my teaching materials as a High School Science & Physics teacher.

These notes and resources are all a work-in-progress. I am completing them as I teach each unit and each year group, so it is likely that you will find them incomplete in many areas.

Please feel free to head over to my git repositories to get a copy of all my resources, to contribute, or just to report bugs.

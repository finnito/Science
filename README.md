Kia ora, my name is Finn Le Sueur and I am a high school science and physics teacher in New Zealand. This website is my contribution to the open web and my way to contributing back to the education profession. I hope that this website can help other teachers with the lesson/unit planning, or just their practice in general.

If you are a student, continue on into the website and I hope you find it useful! If you are an educator and find my content of use, please consider sponsoring me on Github. I would really appreciate it!

## Contributing

All of my planning is available on this website, and you can even personally contribute edits & additions of content by heading over to the Github repository below, or clicking on "Edit this Page" on any of the pages.

## Github Repository

An observatory in Chile recently confirmed an image of a forming planet around a star known as PDS 70. The star is blacked out to show the bright spot just to the right of the centre of the image.

The forming planet is a few times larger than Jupiter and has similar properties to the outer planets of our solar system. However, the surface of the planet has a temperature of around 700 K, making it much hotter than any planet in our solar system.

Explain, in detail, each stage in the formation of this planet. In your answer, you should consider:

- the main stages in the formation of this planet
- why the material in this planet is likely to be different to any inner planets
